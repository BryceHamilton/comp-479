COMP 479 - Project 3
Bryce Hamilton 40050171

Subproject 1
The approach was to use helpers from the Project 1 and Project 2 to do a lot of the heavy lifting,
the helpers read the files and split them up into tokens leaving only duplicates to be removed.

Results: 

number of tokens in SPIMI index: 2853
SPIMI took: 0.06224489212036133
Naive took: 0.10424089431762695
SPIMI is 1.6746899346545423 times faster

Observe that SPIMI, direct appending to posting list is faster for creating index

Subproject 2

See Results in '/results/subproject2'

SPIMI and Original Index return the same results for single keyword test query

The only query return by the index is "George Bush", 
as the other two do not appear together in a single document
(See the AND processor results)

However, the BM25 Ranked Results are returned

The OR processor returns vastly more results for each query,
as expected.
