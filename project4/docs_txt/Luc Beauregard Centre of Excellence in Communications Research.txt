Past, 10:30 a.m. – 12 p.m. OCT 5 Oct 5: Sexual Harassment, Discursive Power, and the Role of Organizational Bystanders Past, 10:30 a.m. – 12 p.m. Posts August 18 2020: Trust & communications: A review of academic research Trust refers to how an individual perceives another actor as behaving in a way that sustains their relationship through time while avoiding behaviour that focusses on their self-interest and is harmful to others. Trust is key for organizations because it plays a critical role in enhancing cooperation, reducing conflicts, and decreasing transaction costs. In this review, we discuss the academic literature on trust and how it relates to communications. More specifically, we unpack what trust means. We explain how trust is built, and we discuss the consequences of trust, which can be beneficial as well as harmful.

On December 6 and 7 2018, we welcomed researchers to our first conference on responsibility (called “Rethinking Responsibility: Agents and Structures”) at Concordia University.
