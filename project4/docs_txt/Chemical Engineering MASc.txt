Additional Admission RequirementsThe Department Graduate Studies Committee will determine the acceptability of an applicant for admission to the program and may require the applicant to do specific remedial coursework, including the bridge course CHME 401 Principles of Chemical Engineering, and/or other course(s) to meet the program requirements. Degree RequirementsFully-qualified candidates are required to complete a minimum of 45 credits. Please see the Engineering Courses page for course descriptions.Chemical Engineering MASc (45 credits)4credits: • CHME 6981 Chemical Engineering Research Protocols and Safety (4.00) 12credits total with a minimum of 4 credits chosen from the Chemical Engineering MASc Core Courses list and a maximum of 8 credits chosen from the Chemical Engineering MASc Electives List with permission of the Graduate Program Director. Students may take an elective course outside the Chemical Engineering MASc Electives List with permission of the Graduate Program Director. Students who take a three-credit course towards their requirement of 12 credits chosen from the Chemical Engineering MASc Core Courses list and the Chemical Engineering MASc Electives List: must take the one-credit course CHME 6001 - Project in Chemical and Materials Engineering to obtain the missing credit.29credits: • ENGR 8901 Master of Applied Science Research and Thesis (29.00) Note: According to the University regulations on transfer of credits, students who have completed a graduate Certificate or Diploma may have courses transferred into a MASc. Please refer to the Transfer Credits section of the Graduate Calendar for further information.
