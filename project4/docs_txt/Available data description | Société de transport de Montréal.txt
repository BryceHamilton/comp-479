This document describes the available data and a few STM specifications. You must also review the legal notes defining the rules and context for using this data. For example, it is strictly forbidden to use the company logo without permission from the STM. You can consult these legal notes. For metro schedules Metro schedules are provided by way of indication only and are essentially used to determine how long a trip will take. They cannot be used to develop an application for metro timetables, as they are only used to estimate the time needed to travel between two stations.
