We have taken care to align our Plan with Québec government initiatives, as stipulated in the Sustainable Development Act. Some of our strategies therefore implement the Government Sustainable Development Strategy(GSDS), while others contribute to Québec’s Agenda 21 for culture. The United Nations Development Programand its 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) also features strongly in our plan and we will pursue the one’s that most closely reflect our own realities.
