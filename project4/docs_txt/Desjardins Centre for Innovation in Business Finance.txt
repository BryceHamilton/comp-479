The Centre’s purpose is to support research that focuses on innovation in business finance and on advances in the financial services sector, with specific reference to the effects on small to medium-sized business customers. Increased competition at all levels of the financial services industry is forcing banks and other financial institutions to address the fundamental financial needs of their business clients, especially those of small and medium-sized enterprises. The Centre supports scholarly initiatives that examine the types of tools and strategies that financial institutions will need to develop to remain competitive. Objectives The Centre’s key objectives are to: Promote and support research and pedagogical initiatives on business finance, especially with respect to small and medium-sized enterprises and financial institutions dealing with the financing of small and medium size enterprises. Promote and support the dissemination and publication of research findings on business finance in academic, pedagogical and professional venues such as workshops, seminars, conferences and journals Provide support to students who are interested in the field of business finance. Enhance interactions and exchanges between the Desjardins Group and John Molson faculty, staff and students.   Calls for proposals The Centre has two open calls for proposals.
