Quebec has several companies that manufacture public transit equipment.. 						Investing in this sector consolidates our industrial base and contributes to the development of expertise. The annual revenue in this industrial sector is more than two billion dollars. To meet the needs resulting from its dependence on automobile transportation, Quebec imported no less than $13.7 billion in oil and $7 billion in automobiles in 2012. Together, these imports  represent 94% of Quebec’s trade deficit. Comparison of spinoffs based on a $10-million expenditure 					The economic impact on the STM’s normal activities was calculated by the firm E&B Data.
