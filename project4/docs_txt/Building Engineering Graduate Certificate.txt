Additional Admission RequirementsThe Department will recommend on the acceptability of an applicant for admission to the program and may require the applicant to do specific remedial course work to meet the program requirements. Degree RequirementsFully-qualified candidates are required to complete a minimum of 16 credits. Please see the Engineering Courses page for course descriptions.Building Engineering Graduate Certificate (16 credits)12credits of courses chosen from one of the following areas of concentration: Building Science Core Courses (Building Engineering Graduate Certificate) Construction Engineering and Management Core Courses (Building Engineering Graduate Certificate) Energy Efficiency Core Courses (Building Engineering Graduate Certificate) Indoor Environment Core Courses (Building Engineering Graduate Certificate) Rehabilitation of Urban Infrastructure Core Courses (Building Engineering Graduate Certificate) Facility Management Core Courses (Building Engineering Graduate Certificate) 4credits chosen from the Building Engineering Graduate Certificate Electives list. Notes:-The program can be completed in one year. Students with high standing in their bachelor program and whose academic records satisfy the requirements for good standing in the Master’s Program in Building Engineering may apply for transfer to the Master’s program.-Core courses for which credits have been credited to another certificate or program must be replaced by elective courses in the area of concentration or by other courses on special permission.
