The John Molson community knows that the use of cases provides unique insights for students: cases highlight real-world business challenges and offer opportunities to connect classroom concepts to business issues. As part of the school's commitment to the case method, the John Molson Case Publications Initiative was founded to support the development of new teaching case studies under the John Molson School of Business banner. By producing relevant case studies customized to our curriculum, often with Quebec-based companies, we forge stronger ties to the business and non-profit community, while providing students with educational opportunities based on where they live and work. Our vision is to support John Molson academic programs through an ever-growing body of work reflecting contemporary and diverse businesses of relevance to faculty and students. 2021 John Molson Business Ownership Case Writing Competition call for cases Winners of the 2021 John Molson Business Ownership Case Writing Competition First Prize: Local Pulse: Growing a Values-Oriented Firm Cheryl Gladu, Thomson Rivers University Second Prize: Cassia at Home: A Restaurant Brand Moves to Home Kitchens Marilyn Anthony, Temple University Shreshthi Mehta, Northeastern University Third Prize: The Business 2B Or Not 2B: Marceco’s Dilemma after the T-Mobile-Sprint Merger Ana Gonzalez, Grand Valley State University David Den Herder, UM Wireless Honorable Mention: Blake Human Services: When Racism is Involved, Is the Customer Always Right?
