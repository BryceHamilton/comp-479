					<h2>Are you eligible for a credit?</h2>
					<p>Further to a class action regarding administration charges (C.S.M.&nbsp;500&#8209;06&#8209;00461&#8209;091), Hydro&#8209;Québec and the complainant have agreed to an out-of-court settlement, even though the court ruled in Hydro&#8209;Québec’s favor in this matter.</p>
					<p>You may be eligible for a credit if you were responsible for a contract and you paid administration charges billed during the period in question (from January 1, 2008, to April 30, 2010).</p>

					<div class="hq-bloc-gris-top margintop-30">
						<h3>Administration charges</h3>
						<p>If your payment is late, in whole or in part, Hydro&#8209;Québec applies administration charges to the unpaid portion of your bill. These charges are calculated using the interest rate in effect on the due date, from that date until your payment is received.</p>

					<h3>Credit for eligible customers </h3>
					<p>The settlement amounts to approximately <strong>$12.6&#8239;million</strong> and will be divided on a prorated basis among customers who paid administration charges for the period in question. These customers will receive a percentage of the charges they paid based on the number of eligible individuals and the total charges paid during the period. </p>

					<h4>Median reimbursement to which you may be entitled </h4>
					<p>The credit will be calculated based on a percentage of the total administration charges billed during the period in question, namely from January&nbsp;1, 2008, to April&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2010, and subsequently paid. </p>

								<h4>Information about the class action</h4>
								<div>
									<p>A class-action lawsuit with the number C.S.M. 500-06-00461-091 was filed in February 2009 regarding the annual rate of Hydro&#8209;Québec’s administration charges, which the complainant argued should have appeared directly on customer bills issued between January 1, 2008, and April 30,&nbsp;2010.</p>
									<p>In November 2020, although the court ruled in Hydro&#8209;Québec’s favor in this matter, Hydro&#8209;Québec and the representative plaintiffs agreed to an out-of-court settlement.</p>
									<p>Further to the court’s approval, the parties agreed to fully and definitively settle their dispute and Hydro&#8209;Québec committed to pay, in accordance with a distribution protocol, the settlement amount resulting from these claims.</p>
									<p>For any questions regarding the credit request process, please contact customer services at 1 877 234-6548, access code 8332 (residential customers) or 8112 (business customers) or the attorneys for the plaintiffs:</p>

								<h4>As an individual, will I receive a cheque?</h4>
								<div>
									<p>If you are responsible for a contract and you are eligible for a credit, you will not receive a cheque. The credit will be applied to one of your bills in early 2022. </p>
									<p>If you are no longer responsible for a contract or the people responsible for the contract changed since January 1, 2008, and your file shows an unpaid balance, all or some of the credit will be used to settle your account. If the remaining amount exceeds $2, you will receive a cheque in the mail. Please confirm your current address so that we can send you a cheque, if applicable. There are different ways you can do this:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Fill out the <a href="/sefco2016/en/class-action-administration-charges.html">Credit Request form</a> by September 6, 2021, and provide the address where you would like to receive the cheque.
											<ul>
												<li>If you are not eligible, we will send you a notice confirming that according to the court-approved settlement agreement, you are not entitled to receive the credit.</li>
												<li>If your request is incomplete, we will contact you using the contact information you provided to request that you send us any information we need to process your request.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>If you are unable to provide us with your current address online, please contact customer services at 1 877 234-6548, access code 8332 (residential customers) or 8112 (business customers) to provide it to us over the phone. However, please note that this process takes longer by phone, particularly if the call volume is high.</li>
									</ul>
								</div>

								<h4>I owe Hydro&#8209;Québec money or I have a payment arrangement. Will I receive a credit?</h4>
								<div>
									<p>If you have an unpaid balance and you do not have a payment arrangement with us, the credit will appear under <strong>Settlement – Class action</strong> and will be applied to the amount due.</p>
									<p>If you have a payment arrangement with us, the credit will appear under <strong>Settlement – Class action</strong> and will be applied to one of your installments.</p>
								</div>

								<h4>I received an electricity bill jointly with other people. Who will receive the credit?</h4>
								<div>
									<p>If you are no longer jointly responsible for a contract with this person or these people and if you are all eligible for a credit, you must fill out the <a href="/sefco2016/en/class-action-administration-charges.html">Credit Request form</a> by September 6, 2021, mand provide an address where you would like to receive the cheque, if applicable. The cheque will be made out to all of the people who were responsible for the contract. <strong>We will not issue a cheque for each person</strong>.</p>
									<p>If you are still jointly responsible for an account with these people, <strong>you don’t have to do anything</strong>. The credit will be applied to one of your bills in early 2022.</p>
								</div>

								<h4>I have several service contracts in the same account. How will the credit be applied? </h4>
								<div>
									<p>If you have several service contracts in the same account, we will calculate the credit for all of the service contracts. The total credit will appear on one of your bills in early 2022.</p>
								</div>

								<h4>How can I request the credit for a deceased person? </h4>
								<div>
									<p>If the deceased person’s estate still has an active contract, <strong>you don’t need to do anything</strong>. In this case, the credit will be automatically applied to that contract.</p>
									<p>In all other cases, supporting documents may be required. Given the many possible situations, please contact customer services at 1 877 234-6548, access code 8332 (residential customers) or 8112 (business customers).</p>
								</div>

								<h4>I was a Hydro&#8209;Québec customer during the period in question (January 1, 2008, to April 30, 2010) and I paid administration charges billed during that period, but I have moved since then and the contract is no longer in my name. Will I receive a cheque?</h4>
								<div>
									<p>You may receive the credit by cheque. Fill out the <a href="/sefco2016/en/class-action-administration-charges.html">Credit Request form</a> by September 6, 2021, and provide the address where you would like to receive the cheque by mail.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>If you are not eligible, we will send you a notice confirming that, according to the court-approved settlement agreement, you are not entitled to receive the credit.</li>
										<li>If your request is incomplete, we will contact you or we will send you a notice requesting that you provide any information we need to process your request. If you receive such a notice, you will have 30 days to send us the information, after which your request will be rejected without further communication.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>If you are unable to provide us with your current address online, please contact customer services at 1 877 234-6548, access code 8332 (residential customers) or 8112 (business customers) to provide it to us over the phone. However, please note that this process takes longer by phone, particularly if the call volume is high.</p>
								</div>
								<h4>I received an email, a text message or a phone call from Hydro&#8209;Québec requesting personal information. Do I need to comply with the request?</h4>
								<div>
									<p>Be careful! We will not ask you to provide personal information in response to an email or a text message.</p>
									<p>However, if you are no longer a Hydro&#8209;Québec customer, we may need additional information to process your request, so we need to know the address where you would like to receive information regarding the credit, provided you are eligible. You may therefore receive a phone call asking you to confirm your address or to fill out the <a href="/sefco2016/en/class-action-administration-charges.html">Credit Request form</a> by September 6, 2021, on our website.</p>
									<p>If you are still a Hydro&#8209;Québec customer, <strong>you do not need to send us any information</strong>. </p>
