To conduct hot work at Concordia, you must: Submit the fire prevention form no less than 2 working days prior to the work or activity. Follow the mandatory hot work safety precautions. Implement any additional precautions or procedures imposed by University fire prevention personnel. Complete the fire prevention form Important: Any person conducting these activities that cause a fire alarm can expose the person conducting the activity to a municipal fine of up to $2700.00. University fire prevention personnel are authorized to inspect the work site and, if necessary, stop all activity if the established requirements have not been adhered to or if any other safety or fire risk is identified. Mandatory hot work safety precautions Before you start your hot work Authorization to conduct hot work is conditional on respecting the basic hot work safety requirements listed here: Advise the nearest building security desk prior to commencing the work or call 514-848-3717 Establish a 11 meters / 35 foot safety zone and restrict its access to all non-essential personnel. Ensure that the safety zone is free of any combustible materials, liquids, vapor and free of dust or other particles that may create a risk of fire or explosion. Ensure that the established equipment and precautions are present and properly utilized. Upon completion of the hot work, call the Security Department at 514-848-3717 Following completion of the hot work, a constant surveillance of the work area must be maintained, for 60 minutes. A follow-up inspection of the work area must be conducted 4 hours after completion of the hot work to ensure that there are no residual heat sources, embers or possibility of combustion. Upon completion of the final inspection, notify security by calling 514-848-3717. Concordia fire prevention and security personnel may impose supplemental safety requirements based on the nature and location of the work being conducted. Failure to implement the established precautions can result in the work being immediately halted and/or cancelled. Any cost associated with special requirements, equipment and/or university charges related to the hot work are the responsibility of the person conducting/coordinating the hot work. Complete the fire prevention form Interruption of fire alarm or sprinkler systems Hot work and maintenance will often result in the interruption or by-pass of a fire alarm or sprinkler system.  Even if a fire alarm system is by-passed, it continues to function however the audible alarms are silenced to avoid unnecessarily evacuating a building due to a planned activity.  Fire alarms are always received and investigated even when the alarm is by-passed. The interruption, bypass or closure, in part or in full, of any fire alarm or sprinkler system must only be undertaken by authorized University personnel or authorized external fire alarm and/or sprinkler service providers.  The online, fire prevention form must be completed no less than 2 working days prior to the scheduled interruption of fire alarm and/or sprinkler systems. Any sprinkler valves that are closed during repairs or for maintenance must be identified with the designated ""fire protection out of service"" warning sign. Warning signs are available at the nearest building security or by calling 514-848-3717. University fire prevention personnel may impose a fire watch/monitor or other precautions judged to be necessary for the duration of the fire protection systems interruption. Any cost associated with special requirements, precautions or equipment and/or university charges related to the interruption of fire protection systems are the responsibility of the person responsible for coordinating the work. Any unauthorized person who tampers with fire alarm or sprinkler systems will be subject to severe internal consequences and potentially criminal charges.

These invitations resulted in reported drugging and sexual assault. Montreal police have been informed and are investigating. The university is cautioning students to be extra vigilant when responding to unsolicited social media offers. If you have any information, or are in need of assistance, please contact: Concordia’s Sexual Assault Resource Centre at 514-848-2424, ext. 3353, or Concordia’s Security Department at 514-848-3717, option 1. We would like to take this opportunity to remind students that Concordia has zero tolerance for sexual violence of any kind. We are committed to creating and maintaining an environment that is safe for all.

SEPT. 25-29: Get training, try the obstacle course and win prizes! September 19, 2017 | By Karen McCarthy From left: Rachel Nielsen, emergency preparedness officer; Ruiting Ji, third-year film animation student; Lyne Denis, investigator-preventionist with the Security Department. | Photo by Concordia University From September 25 to 29, Concordia is holding its first Campus Safety Awareness Week. It’s part of the new and ongoing campaign, Campus Safety: Be Informed, Get Connected. “Safety is always top of mind for us at Concordia,” explains Roger Côté, vice-president of Services. “Our goal is to keep students, faculty and staff safe by ensuring they are aware of our emergency procedures and who to call. Our new campaign focuses on a myriad of facets related to personal, property and campus safety.” Activities during the five days will include booths where the campus community can get more information about being prepared in case an emergency. Staff, faculty and students can also find out how to volunteer to be a member of the Concordia Emergency Response Team (CERT). Plus, there will be two texting-and-walking-obstacle courses — with prizes! Throughout the fall, Campus Safety: Be informed, Get Connected will also focus on IT security, bike and pedestrian safety, and support the ongoing consent and bystander intervention campaigns by the Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC). As part of the promotional materials, two short animated videos have been produced. The first aims to raise awareness about who to call in an emergency (the Security Department at 514-848-3717) and the second video encourages students to download the Alertus + app to receive emergency alerts from the university. By students for students “We wanted to have videos that would appeal to students,” says Rachel Nielsen, emergency preparedness officer. “We teamed up with University Communications Services (UCS) and the Film Animation Program to seek proposals.” This is the second time Concordia has hired students to produce videos to support a campaign. Last year, two film animation students produced a series of videos featuring fruit spokespeople to encourage conversations around consent on campus. These continue to be used as part of SARC’s ongoing outreach efforts. “Animation has so much potential for exploration and, at the same time, it is efficient in storytelling and can carry powerful visuals,” says Ruiting Ji, a third-year film animation student whose submission was chosen by a committee. Members included representatives from Emergency Management, UCS and the Film Animation Program. “Working on the campus safety campaign videos, I wanted to bring out the power of animation by making visually engaging short videos that are relatable,” she adds. “Visually, I explored dynamic animation and rotoscoped backgrounds based on real settings on campus.” Ji was assisted by two students: Emily Huang, a third-year student in film animation, who served as assistant animator and student Luhan Wang who served as assistant background artist and animation colorist. Win a gift card from the Book Stop Boutique During Campus Safety Awareness Week, students, faculty and staff are invited to attend the training session, “Emergencies at Concordia: What you need to know.” You can register online to attend an in-person session (registration is required) on September 28 or 29. Students will automatically be entered in a draw to win one of four $50 gift cards from the Concordia Book Stop Boutique! Faculty and staff have the chance to win one of four $25 gift cards. On Tuesday, September 26, students are invited to participate in a texting-and-walking-obstacle course on the Sir George Williams Campus where they can also win prizes. Another obstacle course will take place on Wednesday, September 27 on the Loyola Campus. Watch the two student-made animated videos about Concordia’s Campus Safety: Be Informed, Get Connected campaign, or take a look at the full schedule of Campus Safety Awareness Week events.   Related links Strategic Direction 8: Go Beyond What to do in an emergency at Concordia Emergency Management Fire prevention Security Department Related topics 	 public safety 	 You might also like: ‘Sharing the street is everyone’s business’ Concordia’s fresh take on consent Trending Concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the Montreal Climate Partnership November 10, 2021 Improvements to Concordia’s Henry F.

It organizes bilingual, public conversations in cafés and community spaces across Montreal. The University of the Streets Café on Hold Due to the COVID-19 pandemic that caused mandatory lockdowns and the closure of all social ventures for many months, we were unable to run the program. And while we are thankful to have maintained many connections remotely, we decided not to move the experience to the virtual world. The University of the Streets was, and is, about much more than sharing information: it connects people and helps foster communities. Although we won’t be convening these conversations at the moment, our work as the Office of Community Engagement continues. If you would like to learn more about our work or share ideas, please contact us. About Our participatory events seek to reinvent the idea of the ‘university’ by creating spaces for lifelong learning, critical thinking and community engagement in local neighbourhoods. Methodology   A public conversation is much like a conversation you’d have with friends or family around a dinner table, except with more people, more points of view, and slightly more structure. Get involved Thanks to the support of our volunteers, venues and parterning organizations, the program is free and open to participants of all ages, backgrounds and levels of education. FAQs What language are the events in? Do I need to register? What is the cost, and answers to other important questions.   Winter-Spring 2020: Our Communities This season of University of the Streets Café looks at questions of belongingness in our cities and neighborhoods. Who gets to experience a sense of belonging in relation to the spaces we live in? Who doesn't and why? To what extent is this sense of connection affected by factors outside of sphere of influence? How can we in turn reclaim our capacity to hold a relationship with our communities? We encourage you to draw your own links between these conversations or to experience them individually. See coverage from our fall 2020 season, The Right to Stay Put: How can we resist being forced out of our neighborhoods? Source, CBC Montreal November 27, 2019. For more information Accessibility We strive to hold all of our public conversations in venues that are accessible to persons with limited mobility.

We are working with the Government of Quebec, public health authorities and the City of Montreal as well as public transit commissions to use an approach centered on the respect of social distancing norms and on the protection of all. As we have done throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we will adhere scrupulously to all public health directives and carefully consider the sanitization and subsequent use of shared spaces such as stairs, elevators and eating areas. How do I re-open my lab? Research labs continue to be opened. Professors should contact the Associate Dean, Research of their Faculty to learn more. There is no longer a need to contact Faculties to add personnel to labs unless a Faculty specifically chooses to maintain this requirement. What are the procedures for assessing the capacity limits of research spaces? Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) will assess new research spaces for capacity limits upon request. For dry labs and meeting rooms, normal capacity of the space is permitted with mask rules. For wet labs, existing capacity as set by EHS can be maintained with all personnel/students being scheduled accordingly and mask rules followed. If a PI wants the capacity increased, they must ask EHS for a new assessment. EHS has prepared guidelines for shared computer labs. What kinds of sanitization protocols are in place? The university is following recommendations and guidelines of the CNESST and has enhanced cleaning and sanitization for areas that are frequented by faculty, staff and students. Additional hand sanitizing stations have been added. In addition, those accessing campus are required to use hand sanitizer upon arrival. Training has been implemented for all individuals accessing campus to ensure a common understanding of expected behaviours for the health and safety of our community. Learn more about the University’s workplace safety guidelines.    Ethics & compliance What are the new Covid-related procedures to conduct in-person research with humans? In-person research with humans will no longer need approval of the Central Committee unless it involves chapter 9 of the TCPS (research with Indigenous communities). The existing form and process are retained in those cases. However, the requirement to submit approval letters from all collaborating institutions/organizations, which include details on specific COVID-related requirements, is still in effect. Please forward all approval letters directly to the Research Ethics Unit, at oor.ethics@concordia.ca, and clearly identify the relevant ethics protocol number linked to the request, before initiating any in-person research activities. Researchers and their participants must follow the processes for Visitors Accessing Campus during the Pandemic. I conduct field research. What do I need to know before I begin? Field research activities will no longer require approval, with the exception of international field research for which the Field Research process will be retained with the Faculty associate dean, research reviewing requests with a copy sent to the Office of the Vice-President, Research and Graduate Studies. International travel for conferences and workshops does not require approval. What can I do to request approval for In-person research that isn't already approved under my current protocol? You are required to submit an amendment request to your existing protocol.​ Since you may eventually wish to return to online/remote research or maintain a hybrid of remote and in-person data collection in the future, please do not remove any methodologies already approved under the protocol; rather simply request the addition of in-person recruitment and data collection. The amendment request must contain: A cover email requesting an amendment to an approved protocol A separate document in PDF outlining any modifications with a clear, detailed explanation as to why the change is being made; list where each document has been modified (SPF and/or supporting documents) Copies of the revised SPF and supporting documents with all changes clearly highlighted; do not resend all your appendices – send only those that pertain to the amendment request Any new appendices; these must be provided as separate documents saved in PDF  ​ All amendment requests should be submitted by email to oor.ethics@concordia.ca. The Secretariat on Responsible Conduct of Research has shared new interpretations from the Panel on Research Ethics to support the community in applying the Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, TCPS 2 (2018) during the current COVID-19 publicly declared emergency. What additional risks can be considered research-attributable during the COVID-19 pandemic? There are three different categories of additional research-attributable risk that can arise in the COVID-19 environment: New risks arising from changes to researcher’s plan for interacting with participants: For example, a researcher may decide to communicate with participants remotely instead of in-person to respect physical distancing and mitigate the transmission/spread of the virus through human contact. While this may address risks related to physical contact, researchers and research ethics boards (REBs) should be mindful that this change introduces new risks and ethics issues related to privacy and confidentiality of information when using digital platforms and home offices, and the need for new security and safety measures to protect participants’ information. Where, for example, researchers attempt to reduce the risk of infection by mailing experimental drugs to participants rather than continuing in-person participation, this will likely require a change to the researcher’s plan for monitoring any side effects. Depending on the participant pool, the change from in-person to remote participation may also introduce new ethics issues related to fairness and equity, where only those with access and ability to participate remotely (e.g. due to internet connectivity, computer/ smart phone availability and capacity) can continue to participate in the research. “…[P]ractices of researchers or REBs, whether intentional or inadvertent, can exclude some members of society from participating in research” (Chapter 4, Introduction). New risks that emerge, even if the research plan remains unchanged: For example, the continued participation of participants who provide weekly blood samples at a hospital may subject them to new risks of exposure to the coronavirus during their commute, or as a result of their proximity to other participants or to members of the research team. Also, new public health requirements for reporting can introduce new risks related to privacy and confidentiality in ongoing research. For example, if new security standards require researchers to retain the participants’ personal information for contact tracing purposes, researchers can no longer guarantee participants’ anonymity (see Application of Article 5.2). In addition to risks of increased participant exposure to the virus, there are possible societal risks of further transmitting the virus beyond the individual participants to other third parties, including family members. Changes in risk levels arising from changes to the participants’ personal circumstances: During the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, “participants … may be rendered more vulnerable by the nature of the emergency” (Application of Article 6.21). Vulnerabilities can be psychological due to isolation, stress, anxiety, or for economic reasons due to financial burdens of the pandemic or unemployment. Vulnerabilities can also be social in nature due to limited access to critical services, or physical vulnerability due to pre-existing medical conditions or age. For example, when research on self-harm or suicide involving participants began in non-pandemic times and continues in a COVID-19 environment, researchers need to re-assess the vulnerability of their participants in the context of research. Researchers should consider the additional stress that participants may be experiencing in their personal life. Participants who take part in ongoing research at a research site may be anxious or fearful about exposure in a potential COVID-19 environment, and may no longer wish to continue participating in research. Similarly, a high-risk research study conducted in-person to test a new drug on immunocompromised patients may be deemed acceptable for those participants in non-pandemic times. However, the risk to participants may rise to unacceptable levels in a pandemic context. Participants may no longer accept risks they would have otherwise accepted in non-pandemic contexts. Others may be willing to accept risks they would not have otherwise accepted, in the absence of a known cure for COVID-19 or COVID related complications; for example, participation in treatment trials for those infected with the virus or participation in prevention trials, including participation in vaccine studies. Are researchers required to amend their applications and consent forms for REB review in light of additional research-attributable risks in a pandemic environment? Changes or unanticipated issues that may increase the level of risk for participants or that have other ethical implications affecting participants’ welfare must be submitted for research ethics board (REB) review (see Articles 6.15 and 6.16). As with other changes to the research, the level of additional risks and their impact on the welfare of participants determine when researchers should report the changes to the REB - whether immediately, or if the researcher can document and summarize the changes in annual status reports. Where applicable, researchers must also provide to the REB their plan to manage additional risks through safety plans or technical safeguards, and their efforts to reach a favorable balance of risks and benefits for participants. As with the assessment of the ethical acceptability of research, the REB review of the changes “involves consideration of the foreseeable risks, the potential benefits and the ethical implications of the research” (Article 2.9). REBs assess those risks that are attributable to the research. The TCPS states that “[w]hen describing the foreseeable risks and potential benefits of research involving participants who are also exposed to other risks, researchers should clearly distinguish between the risks that are attributable to the research, and the risks to which participants would normally be exposed” (Article 2.10). Researchers must inform participants of the changes or unanticipated additional research-attributable risks as part of their “ongoing duty to provide participants with all information relevant to their ongoing consent to participate in research” (Article 3.3). In deciding when, how, and how frequently to advise participants of additional risks, researchers and REBs should be guided by the level of those risks and their impact on the potential welfare of participants. They must also consider whether any other policies or requirements apply to the changed circumstances that create the additional risks. These policies and requirements might be sufficient measures to address the identified risk, and therefore changes to the research are not required. What issues should REBs consider in assessing the researcher’s plan to conduct research in a pandemic environment? The onus is on the researcher to satisfy the research ethics board (REB) that the research can proceed during the pandemic. The following are some questions that REBs should consider in reviewing the ethical acceptability of initial submissions of research or ongoing research in a pandemic environment. Each research is different, and the nature of participant pools varies, so the issues to consider should be tailored on a case-by-case basis. Impact on Study Conduct and its Scientific Validity Can the research involve participants remotely rather than in person? Is the research question still relevant within the context of the pandemic environment? Will the pandemic environment impact or alter the representativeness of the participant sample, or the sample plan, and thus its scientific validity? Has interruption of the research (i.e., the stopping and resumption due to the pandemic), or the availability of research funds, impacted its scientific validity or feasibility? Impact on Risks and Benefits of Research Has the researcher considered new risks attributed to the research as a result of COVID-19 environment? Has the level of risk of previously approved research changed? Can the researcher maintain a favorable balance of risks and benefits? What measures has the researcher taken to mitigate any increased levels of risk? Does resuming the research impose additional burdens on participants (e.g. telecommunications cost) to continue to participate in the research? Does the researcher expect the vulnerability of the participants to change within the context of the research? Are the initial anticipated benefits of research still possible? Impact on the Consent Process Do alternate consent strategies need to be considered, for example seeking consent over the internet rather than in person? Is the information provided to participants as part of the consent process still accurate, or does it need to be updated? Does resumption or continuation of approved research introduce unanticipated changes that may increase the level of risk to require informing the participants as part of the ongoing consent process, for example, informing participants about new information, changed procedures, or changed protections that might affect the participants’ choice to continue to participate in the research? Other Ethics Issues If there is a change to previously approved research, does it raise other ethics issues e.g. inclusion and exclusion issues or new risks related to privacy and confidentiality? In the case of multi-jurisdictional and international research, is the researcher sufficiently aware of the local COVID-19 circumstances in the other sites to be able to assess any changed level of risk to participants, and how this may affect any proposed changes to the study and its procedures? Where research is based on community engagement or research agreements, has the researcher considered how to negotiate or implement any proposed changes (e.g. additional consultation, engagement or permission needed to begin recruitment or resume the research)? Are there other community constraints or institutional permissions required to begin recruitment or resume the research? While not a formal part of REBs’ responsibilities, do REBs have concerns about the safety of researchers and the research team members (e.g. the availability of personal protective equipment) that REBs should share with researchers or refer to other appropriate bodies within the institution? Funding updates Where can I find updates from the Canadian federal funding agencies? For the most up-to-date information, please refer to each agency’s website. Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)  Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) Where can I find updates from the provincial funding agencies? For up-to-date information on Quebec agencies, please refer to the agency's website. FRQNT FRQS FRQSC How can I apply for a grant extension? Please submit the grant extension request form to the Office of Research to request an extension. Canadian Research Continuity Emergency Fund (CRCEF) Program Overview The Canada Research Continuity Emergency Fund (CRCEF) is a temporary tri-council program established to help the research enterprise at Canadian universities and health research institutions that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding under this program is specifically provided to support non-governmental sources of research funding. More about CRCEF Partnerships & innovation Is Concordia currently entering into new research agreements for projects sponsored by private industry or government bodies? Yes, with the understanding that any planned research activities and associated timelines must take into consideration the limitations on access to lab spaces and in-person work.  Please contact a member of the Research Partnerships and Innovation team to discuss the opportunity and establish next steps. I am the Principal Investigator on an ongoing industry- or government-funded research project. What happens if I need to modify the work plan, deliverables or timeline? Requests of this nature must be handled on a case-by-case basis, as every sponsor will differ in its approach.  Please contact a member of our team to discuss the specifics and we will be happy to work with you, in conjunction with the sponsor, to determine what accommodations can be made through an amendment to the existing agreement. Are Declaration of Inventions (DOIs) being accepted and processed by Concordia during this time? Yes, you can still declare a new technology to the Office of Research.  Please contact us for guidance on the process. Travel Can faculty/staff travel? Does this include research travel? Necessary research/academic travel is allowed.  Staff intending to travel outside of Canada for official university business must receive prior authorization from their supervisor. Faculty continue to be required to inform their department chair if the intended travel conflicts with teaching or service responsibilities. Exceptionally and until further notice: faculty, postdoctoral students, graduate students and research personnel who wish to conduct research fieldwork outside of Canada must complete a request for Continuing Essential Field Research Activities. For more information, faculty and staff are encouraged to consult Concordia’s message on work- or research-related travel outside of Canada. The travel registry is to be used for international travel related to Concordia business, in order to provide support in case of an emergency. Travellers are strongly encouraged to complete the registry before any international travel. Read the OVPRGS Notice on travel outside Canada. What are the vaccination requirements for entry to Canada? COVID-19 vaccination requirements for entry to Canada that take effect January 15, 2022, stipulate that only fully vaccinated individuals will be allowed entry into Canada. Barring a very limited number of exceptions, those who are non- or partially vaccinated will be refused entry. Concordia recommends that all faculty, staff and students who are not fully vaccinated should do so as soon as possible or plan to arrive in Canada before January 15, 2022. For more information, Concordians can consult the Government of Canada’s list of approved vaccines.

Grant application submission process The Research Grants unit provides an administrative review of the grant application and will send the faculty member comments and suggestions via e-mail. Using the comments and suggestions, the faculty member will prepare the final version of the application and all necessary copies. The final should be submitted to the OOR at least three working days before the agency deadline, to ensure that the last signature and approval from the University can be obtained. The grant application is then submitted, either electronically or by courier, to the agency. ConRAD is an automated system for the management of research information that allows for the internal review and endorsement of applications of grants and the submission of compliance protocols. Researchers can submit and review documents through ConRAD.   Download the ConRAD checklist View the ConRAD Tutorial Apply for Grant Funding There are still two elements to a research application: Your proposal to the sponsor, and University approval to apply. Available Forms: Grant Details Form Inter-institutional Details Form Seed Funding, Team Grants, Facilities Optimization, and Aid to Research Related Events Programs Easy Steps Open ConRAD. (The link can also be found on Carrefour's My CU Account page.)  Under ""Apply New,"" open the necessary form about one week before the internal deadline. Complete the fields and attach the final version of your proposal. ConRAD automatically routes your request through the internal approval process, ending at the Office of Research (OOR). At the OOR, we can approve your application by: sending it to the sponsor via their online system, or signing the hardcopy, if the sponsor prefers a paper submission. When your proposal is ready for submission to the sponsor, follow the sponsor’s instructions: Sponsors using online systems: submit your final proposal through their system. The OOR will review and forward it to the sponsor. Paper Submissions: OOR will sign the application, and either you or an OOR employee can forward the hardcopy to the sponsor. Using ConRAD does not replace the need to submit your final proposal to the sponsor, but it is required for grant approvals. Submit a HREC protocol Available Forms: Human Research Ethics - Summary Protocol Form Easy Steps Open ConRAD. (You can also find this link on Carrefour's My CU Account page.) Under ""Apply New,"" open a Summary Protocol Form (SPF) prior to the start of the research project. Complete the fields and attach the required documents. ConRAD automatically routes your request through to the Office of Research (OOR). Important: It may take up to six weeks for the committee’s decision. Data collection should not begin until ethics approval has been obtained. ConRAD support Did you try checking the ConRAD FAQ for what you're looking for? You can also view the ConRAD Tutorial.

Site search Concordia Directories Search School of Graduate Studies COTUTELLEGive your PhD a global perspective Did you know you can pursue doctoral research at more than one university? A cotutelle opens doors to international researchers and gives you a joint PhD.   A cotutelle refers to an agreement on joint supervision between two universities at the doctoral level. It allows the students to get a joint PhD degree delivered and recognized by both institutions. Full-time doctoral students can take advantage of an exceptional opportunity to earn a joint PhD degree while developing strong connections with international partners. Through the cotutelle program, PhD candidates work in collaboration with distinguished faculty members from Concordia and an international partner university to produce an original thesis. The program requires that students satisfy each institution's minimum requirements and submit their dissertation to both universities prior to graduation. Successful candidates receive a PhD degree from Concordia and the partner institution. Benefits of a cotutelle For the student Opportunities for international research Collaborations with other researchers A recognized joint degree from Concordia and the partner university  For the university Expansion of international relationships for Concordia Raises Concordia’s visibility abroad as a centre of cutting-edge research Provides supervisors and faculty members with opportunities to develop international collaborations Candidate FAQs Where can I do a cotutelle? You are eligible to register at any international accredited university that is open to a cotutelle agreement. Concordia supervisors must approve the partner university and agree to work in collaboration with the chosen co-supervisor. How can I apply as a Concordia student? Discuss the cotutelle plan with your current Concordia supervisor Contact Irene Grigoropoulos, graduate admission advisor at the School of Graduate Studies, to discuss a potential cotutelle before communicating with the partner university If approved, reach out to your potential co-supervisor at the partner university Follow the requirements needed to enrol at the partner university Complete a Cotutelle Agreement form with your supervisor, in collaboration with Irene Grigoropoulos All other required signatures will be collected by the School of Graduate Studies Once both universities approve the cotutelle program, you will be admitted Do I have to submit an admission application to the partner university? Yes, you must follow the partner university’s application/admission procedures. Do I have to pay tuition fees? You will pay tuition for the terms you are registered at Concordia University (a minimum of 3 non-consecutive terms are required). You need to contact the partner university for questions about their tuition fees. Do I have to start the cotutelle in the first term of my PhD? No. However, the cotutelle arrangement should be established as early as possible. Am I still eligible to receive funding if I hold a Federal or Provincial Granting Agency award? Yes, in most cases. It is best to contact the Graduate Awards Office to ensure that your particular award is eligible. Do I still receive my Concordia University internal scholarship when registered at the partner institution? Internal funding administered through the School of Graduate Studies will be honored when abroad. Students must seek approval for any internal awards administered through their department or Faculty while away on a cotutelle. Ready to begin?

Besides your studies, keeping on top of money will be one of your biggest challenges. In short: you’re going to have to learn how to live on a budget! Sound boring? It doesn’t have to be – but it is an essential part of succeeding at university. Why? Most of the cash you will spend is going to be borrowed money. Eventually, that borrowed money will have to be paid back. Budgeting will help you be better prepared to pursue your goals.  Making a budget is not as hard as you may think it is.   A budget is basically an itemized summary of likely income and expenses for a given period of time. Budgets help you determine whether you can buy that afternoon Venti Latte or head home and make your own instead.   A budget provides you with a tangible, organized, and easily understood analysis of how much money you have coming in and going out. It’s an invaluable tool to help you prioritize your spending and manage your money—no matter how much or how little you have.   Get started: plan your budget Let's start this process by organizing your money management into a few helpful steps.

This includes items left unattended in libraries. Security agents will leave a postcard in place of the confiscated item with pick-up instructions.   Tips to prevent thefts in Concordia residences Have your Concordia ID card and room key with you at all times. Do not let visitors or strangers into the residences. Should you notice someone or something suspicious, immediately inform Security at 514-848-3717. Lock your doors before leaving the premises. Avoid posting a message on your door informing people you are away. If you intend to be away for an extended period of time, inform the Residence Director of your absence and expected date of return. Never leave the access doors to the residences open.   Tips to prevent thefts at the office Lock your doors, filing cabinets and drawers while away from your office. Have a password on your computer to protect your information. Never leave valuables in plain sight. If there are strangers in your area who do not seem to have a purpose for being on campus, you can contact Security 514-848-3717 or ext. 3717 from a university phone.

Do not leave your laptop, bags, or other personal belongings unattended. Be sure to remove any peripherals (for example, USB memory keys, hard drives, CDs, DVDs) from your computer. Do not rely on others to watch over your personal possessions. Remember: You are the only person responsible for the protection of your personal property. Back to top Bike theft prevention Did you know approximately 2000 bikes are reported stolen in Montreal annually? Follow these guidelines to prevent becoming a victim of bicycle theft: Register your bike: You can register your bike online, with the Tandem organization, or at your local SPVM station. Lock your bike to one of the designated bike stands on campus. Use a reliable lock, take any easily removable pieces with you. Choose different locations to lock your bike, rather than the same place every day. Document your bicycle information, such as year, model, colour, number of speeds, serial number, etc. Sign up for Project Numéro with the SPVM to have your bike engraved and registered. Have your bike engraved at Concordia (offered in conjunction with SPVM) during the month of September.   For more information on theft prevention: Theft prevention, Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal Back to top Fraud and cyber safety Perpetrators of fraud are successful because they prey on our carelessness in our daily lives.  By being careless when conducting business transactions, when responding to calls or to requests for donations solicited over the internet, or when discarding personal documents without shredding them, we increase the risk of becoming victims of fraud. The most common types of fraud are: Bank or credit card fraud Internet fraud Identity fraud For more information, see Fraud, Service de police de la Ville de Montréal Protect your devices and data In addition to the helpful tips below, Concordia’s IT Services has guidelines and tools to help you keep your devices and data safe.

Cohen Ricardo Dal Farra: “Arts and sciences are both about trying to have a positive impact on the world.” Ricardo Dal Farra of Concordia’s Department of Music is one of a number of researchers whose transdisciplinary work and teaching combines art, science and technology. “In many ways arts, sciences and technology grew over the past decades into very distinct and practically separate disciplines,” Dal Farra says, adding that there has been a lot of recent and encouraging work on interdisciplinarity, which supports collaborations between disciplines. But the disciplines themselves often remain fairly disconnected. “I’m interested in transdisciplinarity. I like the hyphenated term ‘art-science,’ because it implies a real integration of multiple perspectives,” he adds. “In many ways, of course, arts and sciences have their own distinct methodologies and methods of inquiry. The sciences are perhaps more focused on certain kinds of analytic and empirical understanding, whereas the arts are more focused on communication and expression.” But Dal Farra notes that more and more, there are problems, projects and ways of thinking that don’t fit so neatly into any single discipline. At the margins, the differences between disciplines can start to blur. “They’re both different ways of communicating and thinking through complexities. They’re both about trying to have a positive impact on the world.” C-Transmedia Research Center An Academics Without Borders (AWB) project was recently approved and funded in which Dal Farra will act as a volunteer expert consultant at the C-Transmedia Research Centre of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at the University of Caldas in Manizales, Colombia. AWB is a Canadian nonprofit that works with universities in the most disadvantaged countries building their capacity to educate the professionals and leaders essential to building the strong societies they desire. The goal of the art-science research centre at Caldas is to address social and economic inequalities affecting people in the region. Part of the project is also to develop a master’s program in art-science at Caldas. The researchers involved expect that new educational opportunities will have a direct social impact on the communities of students in the program. Graduates will be equipped to address local problems through creative means, taking advantage of their studies in art-science. A course that Dal Farra created, Transdisciplinary Creation and Performance, has run at Concordia for a number of years. He will bring this teaching expertise and his research to Caldas to help start their program. International, interuniversity collaboration Dal Farra points out that the C-Transmedia Research Centre isn’t the beginning of the collaboration, however. It’s just the most recent project in a long series of work together. He has been involved with the University of Caldas extensively over the past 10 years. “It’s great to have AWB support this important project. It’s nice to have our ongoing work recognized,” he says. “The potential of Concordia is amazing. There are many people working between the arts and sciences. And there are many artists, scientists and technology experts at Caldas as well. We’ve all benefited from our ongoing exchanges.” At the moment Dal Farra is helping get the research centre going and the art-science program started. He is doing so remotely until international travel is feasible again. “I’ve visited Caldas with my Concordia colleagues over the course of many years. I’ve also been there with graduate research assistants and with undergraduates, giving them an International Field School study opportunity,” he adds. “It’s been a great experience for everyone. It always helped open Concordia students to new ideas. It gave them contacts in new countries, exposure to new cultures. It’s all part of the same, multi-perspective approach to research and education.”   Find out more about Academics Without Borders and its current call for project proposals.

Looking for a new perspective on your studies and the opportunity to work with students from other departments? Spend some time in another country through a summer field school! Concordia International’s Field Schools give students the opportunity to visit another country for hands-on experiential learning led by Concordia faculty. Students in the programs, which last anywhere between 10 days and six weeks also earn credits toward their degrees. Two students who took part in 2019 summer field schools shared what they learned and most enjoyed about their experiences. Learning from Minimalism in Japan Beatriz Wolanski Brito, a master’s student in design, spent 17 days at the Make in Japan Short-term Design Field School last May. The field school is led by Guillaume Pelletier, a visiting scholar in the Department of Design and Computational Arts. It gives students the opportunity to learn about Japanese design, architecture, fashion, art, game design and more, through visits to museums, galleries and architectural sites in multiple cities across the country. Participants also have the opportunity to do a project exchange with students from the Tama Art University in Tokyo. “We got pretty immersed, going to several places in Tokyo and looking at how the city is organized,” Wolanski Brito says. An architectural project by Ryue Nishizawa at the Teshima Art Museum in Japan. The students also visited Kamakura, Kyoto and the island of Teshima in southwest Japan. Wolanski Brito says her favourite part of the trip was going to the Teshima Art Museum on the island, which hosts a single piece of artwork — an architectural project by Ryue Nishizawa. “It’s a summary of all things Japan and how different their culture and art philosophy is.” Wolanski Brito, who is working on illustrations for a history of Quebec textbook, says she was inspired by the Japanese approach to art and design. “It’s very meditative and very minimalist. As a designer, there’s that anxiety of putting as much information as possible in the work, whereas their art and their design leaves something to the imagination. It makes the public reflect upon the art rather than providing all the answers.” Her advice for someone considering a field school? Take the chance. “It’s an interesting way of getting out of your own project and practice and experiencing a new environment.” Paule Gilbert: “It was very stimulating to be beside people who were working and thinking differently.” Getting site-specific in Copenhagen Paule Gilbert, a Master of Fine Arts candidate in the Studio Arts, Fibres and Material Practices concentration, participated in the Urban Scenographies Field School in Copenhagen last May. Shauna Janssen, assistant professor in the Department of Theatre and the Concordia University Research Chair in Performative Urbanism, led the program. It was attended by 12 students from the departments of Theatre, Studio Arts, Design and Computation Arts, and Geography, Planning and Environment. Participants stayed at Teaterøen, or Theatre Island, located on Refshaleøen, a de-industrialized man-made island across the harbour from Copenhagen. During the 17-day trip, they engaged in performative mapping and undertook assignments that responded to the rapidly changing environment of the island. They also got to explore the city. Gilbert says the program gave her the opportunity to further develop her ability to work site-specifically. At Teaterøen, she made a kite and got her fellow trip mates to map themselves onto it before they flew the kite over the site “to have it reflecting upon itself.” She also captured scenes around Copenhagen and incorporated the images into her drawings. Gilbert says she appreciated the opportunity to work with people from other disciplines. “When we were guided to look at something, we all had very different ways of doing so — not only in the response, but even our frame of analysis was different,” she says. “I think we learned from each other, and it was very stimulating to be beside people who were working and thinking differently.” After her field school program concluded, Gilbert came away with new skills to use in her own artistic practice. While she was in Copenhagen, she says, she didn’t have all the resources she usually needs for her work. “That forced me to develop a way of combining different mediums that I had never thought of before and that I’m still working on now,” she explains, such as inserting media into her drawings. The group also created a book to document their time at Teaterøen, which launched at Concordia’s 4TH SPACE in November. Want to travel and learn abroad this summer?

The national, not-for-profit organization works with universities, companies and government organizations to build partnerships that support industrial and social innovation in Canada. Through funding from the Mitacs Globalink program, Domínguez travelled to Canada to complete a three-month research internship with Brandon Findlay, associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. “The internship was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Domínguez says. “It gave me the chance to explore a different career path and to decide the type of research I wanted to conduct. It helped me develop new skills, all while getting to know amazing people and learning about a new culture.” The Mitacs Globalink Research Internship is a competitive initiative offered through Mitacs to international senior undergraduates from Mitacs partner countries. Each year, top-ranked applicants participate in a collaborative research internship under the supervision of Canadian university faculty members across various academic disciplines. “Mitacs plays an important role in developing the next generation of innovators and connecting Canada to the global scientific and innovation community,” says Julio Sevilla, international project manager at Concordia International. ‘Some of the best and brightest research talent from around the world’ Domínguez previously studied bioprocess engineering at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education in Mexico. She completed her internship and advanced into a PhD in biochemistry at Concordia last fall. She continues to work with Findlay, studying the evolution of antibiotic resistance. “The Mitacs internship was very helpful because I was able to travel to Canada with all my expenses paid, which allowed me to focus on the research,” Domínguez notes. “Now that I started the PhD, Mitacs funding is helping me advance my work as they offer a fellowship for former interns returning to Canada to pursue their graduate studies.” The Globalink Graduate Fellowship offers all Globalink Research Internship alumni the chance to come back to Canada for their graduate studies through direct financial support. “Mitacs allows Concordia to attract some of the best and brightest young research talent from around the world and offers students the chance to develop talent and ideas between academia and industry in Canada and abroad,” Sevilla adds. “Student interns benefit from hands-on experience and being exposed to different corporate cultural perspectives that inspire their creativity and drive their innovation. This allows them to build professional networks and partnerships along the way.” Find out more about internship and other research funding opportunities from Mitacs and entrance awards for students who pursue graduate studies at Concordia.

A career in research begins with a single question, and this summer a cohort of high-achieving Concordia students received funding to conduct research in search of an answer. Together with faculty advisors, undergraduate students with a keen interest in research submitted their proposals to the Concordia Undergraduate Student Research Awards (CUSRA) Program and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Undergraduate Student Research Awards Program. For the summer of 2021, 130 Concordia undergraduate students received funding to explore what a career in research could look like. Of those, 51 students claimed the NSERC award, with the remaining 79 taking up the CUSRA. The Undergraduate Research Showcase The summer’s projects were highlighted at the eighth annual Undergraduate Research Showcase, which took place virtually for the second year in a row due to pandemic restrictions. Twenty of this year’s winners created videos to present their research projects and experience highlights. The questions they tackle cover timely topics: Micaël’s Prior History of Mental Health Symptoms Predicts Symptom Severity During the COVID-19 Pandemic asks if pandemic restrictions affected people with previous mental health struggles more acutely. David Rose’s Cocoon/ChrysalisALONE, research and creation explores nature’s creative gifts in an historical Indigenous Abenaki space. Gala Licheva’s Hybrid Electric Sizing Tool helps measure the efficiency of a propeller-driven aircraft to lower its carbon footprint. Learn more about Gala’s NSERC-funded summer research project. Carlie Lubotta’s Does Age Influence the Ability to Learn New Technology? challenges ageist stereotypes by testing the technological acumen of “Under 45s” and “Over 45s.” About the funding The two programs provide research funding to undergraduate students in a variety of disciplines. The CUSRA program is offered by Concordia’s Office of the Vice-President, Research and Graduate Studies (OVPRGS) and supports projects in the fine arts, social sciences, humanities, engineering and computer science, business disciplines, and natural and health sciences. NSERC funds science and engineering projects. “Investing in research at the undergraduate level benefits the Concordia community in multiple ways,” explains Paula Wood-Adams, interim vice-president of research and graduate studies. “Students engage in experiential learning while broadening their understanding of what a research-based career and graduate degree may look like. They do this while furthering their supervisor’s work and directly making their mark on the next-generation research conducted at Concordia.” Enjoy this video playlist of 20 research projects created by Concordia undergraduate students who received the Concordia Undergraduate Student Research Awards and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Undergraduate Student Research Awards this summer.   Related topics 	 research 	 	 learning 	 	 students 	 You might also like: Concordia aerospace engineering student flies high at Quebec’s Hats Off to You!

Now what? Congratulations on your admission to Concordia! Carefully read your letter of permission, sent to you by email, to learn about what you need to do next as a Concordia student. Don’t forget these key steps: Check for possible fee exemptions Quebec residents pay a lower tuition rate at Concordia. If you are a Quebec resident, make sure you confirm your residency status with Concordia before the fee payment deadline to avoid extra charges. In some situations, non-residents qualify for the Quebec tuition rate. If you meet the criteria, apply online for Quebec residency status through My Student Centre (click “Personal Information” and select “Quebec Residency Application”). Avoid a permanent code surcharge All students in Quebec have a permanent code. Provide Concordia with your permanent code by filling out the form online in My Student Centre to avoid extra fees. If you don’t already have a permanent code, Concordia will issue one when you fill out the form. Submit immigration documents, if you are an international student approved to register at Concordia. Recommended courses Some Concordia degree and certificate programs require you to take certain courses to be eligible for admission. Others will suggest that you take courses as an independent student that will count towards your future program. If you studied at CEGEP and this is your first time studying at Concordia, you may be entitled to a course exemption, which means you will be exempt from the requirement to take that specific course. Make sure to check if you are entitled to any course exemptions, so that you do not repeat the course at Concordia! Reference the recommended courses for independent students and browse the Arts and Science elective courses open to independent students. Course registration For instructions on how to register for courses, follow our step-by-step guide. Registration dates Independent students begin registering for courses after degree program students have the chance to register. This is approximately one month before the beginning of the academic term. Registration dates for independent students Term Independent student status Registration start date Registration end date (DNE deadline)* Summer 2021 Newly accepted March 22, 2021 Dates vary Returning Fall 2021 Newly accepted August 2, 2021 September 20, 2021 Returning Winter 2022 Newly accepted November 25, 2021 January 19, 2022 *You must submit an Independent Student Request Form [PDF] to be considered for late registration. International Students: You will only be able to register for courses once you have shared your Certificat d'acceptation du Québec (CAQ) and study permit with the International Students Office. Maximum course load Independent students can register for fewer than 12 credits per academic term (Fall, Winter or Summer). If you would like to exceed this maximum and take 12 credits, you must submit a special request. Course scheduling tips: Set aside a minimum of five hours of study time each week per course (in addition to the time you spend in class). Consider all of your commitments as you plan your schedule to balance your academic work with any other work and/or personal commitments. Course Prerequisites Some courses at Concordia have a prerequisite requirement, meaning that the course requires you to first take the prerequisite (first) course before you take the next course. If you want to take a course with prerequisites, you will need to show that you have already completed the prerequisite course by completing a Prerequisite Waiver Form. Prerequisite waivers can be a time-consuming process, so don’t wait until the last minute to submit one. Be proactive! TIP: If you have not previously completed certain prerequisite courses, it’s best to fit them into your schedule now, so that you have access to your desired course in a later semester. Academic regulations As an independent student, you follow the same Concordia rules and regulations as certificate or degree program students. You can find the academic regulations in the undergraduate calendar. Once you’ve been granted authorization to register for courses as an undergraduate independent student, this is valid for 3 years. This means that even if you don’t register for any courses in the term you first applied to, you can register for courses for up to 3 years without submitting a new application. You will only need to submit a new application after three years of not taking any classes. Need an exception? The Independent Student Request Committee reviews exceptions to academic regulations, or related matters. You may submit an Independent Student Request Form and supporting documentation directly to the Independent Student Request Committee. Decisions are normally made within (30) working days of receiving the request and will be final. Types of exceptions include: Late withdrawals Registering for 12 credits in one term Taking a course for a third time Withdrawing from a course: DNE & DISC It is your responsibility to officially withdraw from a course. There are two main ways you can withdraw from a course in your online Student Centre during the academic term. Not attending classes or telling an instructor you want to withdraw is not the same as officially withdrawing from a course. If you do not officially withdraw before the deadlines below, you will automatically receive a failing grade and are still responsible for full payment of tuition and other fees. Did Not Enter (DNE) Withdraw from courses with no academic penalty Receive a full tuition refund Did Not Enter"" (DNE) courses will not appear on your transcript and will not affect your grade point average (GPA) DNE deadlines* Summer Term Dates vary by session Fall Term September 20, 2021 Winter Term January 19, 2022 Non-standard term dates  Not all courses fall within the standard term dates and deadlines. Please refer to term dates and deadlines. *After the DNE deadline, you must submit an Independent Student Request Form if you want to withdraw from a course with no academic or financial impact. Discontinued (DISC) Withdraw from courses with no academic penalty Must pay all tuition and course fees (including winter-term tuition for year-long courses) Discontinued (DISC) courses will appear on your transcript, with a grade of “DISC” Discontinued (DISC) courses will not affect your grade point average (GPA)   DISC deadlines* Summer Term Dates vary by session Fall Term November 8, 2021 (Note: Deadline has been extended to December 7, 2021) Winter Term March 21, 2022 Non-standard term dates  Not all courses fall within the standard term dates and deadlines. Please refer to term dates and deadlines. *After the DISC deadline, you must submit an Independent Student Request Form if you want to drop a course. Transfer Credits Courses you take as an Independent student may count towards a degree program or certificate, if you achieve a minimum grade of C-. The acquired credit and final grade transfer to the degree program, if eligible.  Up to a maximum of 30 credits earned as an independent student can transfer to a degree program.

Information for... Future students Student hub Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search Department of Sociology & Anthropology CALL FOR APPLICATIONS The Queen Elizabeth Scholars (QES) has funded the QES-Advanced Scholars West Africa (QES-AS-WA), a program that will inform progress on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Program  Eligibility  Activities  When & where  Award amount  Selection criteria  Apply  Program overview Concordia University has collaborated with the University of Ghana to promote an exchange of ideas on gender equality between Canadian scholars and civil society institutions and their West-African counterparts. This partnership will encourage critical examinations of global gender equality discourses and practices through its focus on gendered praxis that takes local politics and agency seriously and that is purposefully grounded in the narratives and initiatives of local women and agencies in Ghana, Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire and Canada. While women-focused needs and gender-sensitive strategies have made significant strides into the arena of global governance, many feminist scholars and activists have pointed to gender mainstreaming’s ‘failure’ to truly empower women at the grassroots level. We recognize that globalized processes and practices are often mediated and transformed in local contexts, offering us opportunities for transformation and counter-hegemonic narratives. Through this program we seek to contribute to research that examines African knowledge systems and activism around discourses of gender equality. Our hope is to help decolonize knowledge in both Canada and West Africa by developing a multi-layered analysis of pressing gender-related issues.  The topic of this project was kept broad on purpose to allow contributions from various scholarly disciplines and diverse sectors. Research issues will include but are not limited to:  Women and development Feminist discourses and agenda Decolonial work and gender in Africa Women and Health Women and Education Transnational gender justice Transnational feminist theories Our team, composed of Dr. Océane Jasor (Sociology and Anthropology, Concordia University), Dr. Deborah Atobrah (CEGENSA, University of Ghana), Dr. Charlotte Wrigley-Asante (CEGENSA, University of Ghana), and Dr. Cyrelene Amoah-Boampong (CEGENSA, University of Ghana), will support a network of exceptional scholars from various disciplines who are at the doctoral, postdoctoral and early career stages. Eligibility criteria Propose research that reflects on the successes and failures of gender mainstreaming and development in Africa and/or African discourses and practices on gender equality. Candidates must be one of the following: Doctoral researcher: an individual who has completed all coursework and is at the dissertation stage of their PhD. Postdoctoral researcher: an individual who is conducting research after the completion of their PhD, who usually works under the mentorship of a lead researcher or a principal investigator. Early-career researcher: an individual with a PhD, who has demonstrated strong evidence of work as an independent researcher, has led their own laboratory or research project for 4–6 years, or is in a tenure-track position at a degree-granting institution. Outbound candidates must be Canadian citizens or residents. Outbound candidates must be able to travel to Ghana, and residents of the eligible West African countries must be able to travel to Canada and Ghana for a minimum of 30 days. Inbound candidates must be residents of the eligible West African countries involved in this project: Ghana, Senegal and Cote d’Ivoire and must be affiliated to a degree-granting institution in those countries. Francophone candidates must be able to work and communicate in English. Program’s activities Researchers at Concordia University will partner with the Centre for Gender Studies and Advocacy (CEGENSA) and the Institute of African Studies (IAS) at the University of Ghana. The set of activities that will be implemented will create learning opportunities, and forge new partnerships and research collaborations between partner institutions and civil society organizations. For the duration of the program, the 16 scholars will: Help organize and participate in research-related activities (academic conference, roundtables, joint publications). Participate in career-building activities (leadership trainings, workshop on writing and publishing, symposium with QES network of alumni). In order to better grasp the complexity of local gender discourses, the program integrates research and professional training with actual work within women’s non-governmental organizations (WNGOs) and civil society organizations both in Montreal and in Ghana. Selected scholars will spend at least 30% of the total research award time working with a non-academic research placement partner. Obtaining experiential learning is paramount to this project. Participating scholars will be exposed to different epistemological knowledges, world-views and advocacy tactics and priorities. The reflective process that the ensuing conversations will generate is in and of itself pregnant with academic and non-academic possibilities. Devise a plan for the consolidation of a Canada-West Africa network of scholars; think through what a mutual, effective, and transformative partnership between Canadian and West African scholars, institutions, and civil societies can look like. Participate in community engagement activities. When and where does it take place? This is a two-year program. Candidates are expected to commit to the program until December 22, 2023. They must be willing and able to participate in all activities for the duration of the program. In year 1 (August 2022): West African scholars will participate in a 35-day visiting fellowship at Concordia University in Montreal, where they will have the opportunity to participate in academic and community-based exchanges with Canadian researchers. In year 2 (August 2023): Canadian and West African (Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire) scholars will participate in a 35-day visiting fellowship at the University of Ghana in Accra, where they will have the opportunity to participate in academic and community-based exchanges with scholars in Ghana. Amount of award QES scholars will be eligible to receive funding to cover QES justified eligible expenses for a maximum of $6,000 CAD: Travel expenses International airfare (the most direct and economical route) Airport taxes Visas, medical insurance Immunization Ground transportation Living allowance Accommodation Local transportation Food and communications and all other personal expenses Research expenses Remuneration for research assistants Resources for the research (e.g., journals, data) as well as computer and laboratory services.  Subsidies to support teaching replacements at the West African partner institution Costs associated with conference participation Selection criteria Candidates will be evaluated based on the following criteria: Research must engage with discourses of gender equality critically and/or from a decidedly African perspective  Quality of research Interest in feminist praxis grounded in the lived experiences of grassroots communities Interest in contributing to long-term collaboration with the University of Ghana and Concordia To apply The application process is two-fold.

When severe weather is on the way, university officials work to evaluate the potential impact on the Concordia community and responds as follows: If there is a chance that the university may close the next day, Concordia sends out an email to all its members advising the community of the weather conditions and asking them to consult Concordia.ca the next morning, before coming to campus. This email is generally sent out by 4:00 p.m. Concordia will decide whether or not to close the university by 6:00 a.m. the following morning. This decision will be posted on Concordia.ca. That information appears at the top of the webpage, within a yellow banner. Those who have followed the recommendation of subscribing to the Rave Guardian mobile app would also receive the information as a notification. By 6:00 a.m. on the day after a weather-related closure, the university updates Concordia.ca with confirmation that normal operations have resumed or continues to be closed, as appropriate. Frequently Asked Questions How will I know whether the university is open or closed? If there is a chance that the university may close the next day, Concordia sends out an email to all its members advising the community of the weather conditions and asking them to consult Concordia.ca the next morning, before coming to campus. Concordia’s Emergency Operations Centre will decide whether or not to close the university by 6:00 a.m. the following morning. This decision will be posted on Concordia.ca, and will appear at the top of the webpage, within a yellow banner. What factors are taken into consideration in the university’s decision to stay open or to close? Concordia’s Emergency Operations Centre takes a number of variables into consideration when deciding whether a university closure is warranted: Warnings issued by Environment Canada, including hazard-specific information such as predicted levels of snowfall, precipitation, freezing rain, and/or wind Advisories issued by Transport Quebec to avoid non-essential travel on roads Potential risks to safety on campus, e.g., is there adequate heating/ventilation and lighting; have emergency exits been cleared from snow and ice?  Any other hazards known at that time What services are affected when the university closes? When the university closes, all activities, exams, labs and classes, including evening classes, are cancelled. All services, including day cares, Health Services, Le Gym, PERFORM Centre, Vanier and Webster Libraries, and Grey Nuns Reading Room are closed. In addition, all cafeterias -- with the exception of the cafeterias in the Grey Nuns Building (SGW), Hingston Hall (Loyola) and the Campus Centre (Loyola) -- are closed. All events scheduled to take place on that day are cancelled, including events at the Stinger’s Dome. Who is expected to come to work when the university is closed? Staff and faculty are not expected to report to work when the university is closed. However, all required Facilities Management operational personnel/all trade employees as well as all Security Department personnel must come to work. What if an exam is scheduled during a university closure? Students who have questions about their classes, labs, activities or exams – including online exams or classes -- that were to be held on the day during which the university closed should speak directly to their professor. What if I have borrowed a book or a laptop from the library and it’s due on the day of a university closure? All library materials (including equipment such as laptops and tablets) that were due the day of a closure will be due on the day the university reopens. What should employees who are parents of school-aged children do if the schools are closed but the university remains open? As long as the university is open, staff and faculty are expected to report to work. As in any other circumstance that prevents an employee from coming to work, the affected employee should speak directly to their manager to make arrangements.

The University Senate reserves the right to modify the academic programs and regulations at its discretion after the posting date of the Calendar. In addition, the University reserves the right to modify the posted scale of tuition and other student fees and to limit the number of students who enrol in any program or course at any time before the beginning of an academic term. Moreover, the information contained in the Undergraduate Calendar or any other University document related to academic programs, deadlines, and regulations is subject to verification and correction by the Office of the Registrar and the School of Graduate Studies.

Information for...   Future students Student hub Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search Celebrity couples help each other navigate the ultimate gig economy, new Concordia research shows A spouse’s social capital is a valuable commodity in an industry where the biggest names own little other than their appeal December 7, 2021 | By 		Patrick Lejtenyi From Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall to Tom Holland and Zendaya, the Hollywood celebrity couple has always been an object of fascination and envy. But how does the Hollywood celebrity function as a business venture? Project-based industries like film and television rely heavily on networks: the adage “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know” applies as much now as ever. In a study published in the journal Family Business Review, three Concordia researchers look at how celebrity marriages can affect both partners’ career prospects. The researchers examined how a spouse’s professional network can help boost career outcomes, from more roles to ascending managerial ranks on the film production side. The study combines family business theory with network theory and is applied to a unique industry that prizes celebrity capital as a vehicle for economic capital. “Our motivation was determining whether or not marrying someone in the same field will help further a career when the whole industry is based on temporary projects,” says Yasaman Gorji, an assistant professor of management at the John Molson School of Business and the study’s lead author. “Does this kind of support exist, and could it help women especially shatter the glass ceiling?” Michael Carney, Concordia University Research Chair in Management, and Rajshree Prakash, an assistant professor of management, co-authored the paper. Yasaman Gorji: “Their spouse's networks help women get projects but not necessarily rise in the hierarchy.” Rising stars get a boost Gorji’s research began with the construction of a massive database of film industry personalities and couples dating back to the late 19th century, at the inception of cinema. For this study, she limited her analysis to some 1,200 couples who were active between 1970 — toward the end of the studio system era and the birth of a more diffuse and independent Hollywood — to 2010. These subjects were considered core crew members, either in front of or behind the camera, and had established careers in the years prior to marriage. Noting that the industry they are studying has a distinct hierarchy, the researchers designated one spouse as supporting and one receiving: one was leveraging his or her clout to support the other’s career. True to Hollywood’s reputation of being male dominated, the supporting spouse is more often male and the receiving female. To determine the effects of the marriage on the careers of the subjects, the researchers studied data from five years prior to marriage to three years following it. They also tracked career roles, moving either upwards from acting into producing or directing, downwards from producing and directing into strictly acting, writing or other roles, or no change in role in the three years after marriage. Controls for age at the time of marriage, gender and industry experience were considered in the data analysis. The receiver’s role type before marriage, marriage termination type, if any (separation, divorce or death) and Oscar wins before marriage were also controlled. Closed groups get more work They found that the size of a spouse’s professional network did have an impact on a receiver getting cast in more projects. But they benefitted more from access to networks that were tightly knit rather than those that were loose and wider cast.   “We often see content producers working recurrently with one another,” Carney says. “It’s like an ongoing team. We didn’t look for that, but we did find evidence that access to cliques or relatively closed networks was more helpful than having people who could bridge large numbers.” They also noted that men were more likely to move into directing and producing after marriage than women. The researchers add that there was no evidence that women gained more from a marriage than men in moving up hierarchies into producing or directing. “This paper is important because it brings up the idea of the hybridized family,” Gorji explains. “They are in the same business but do not own a firm. But they are helping each other get more  projects. Their networks help them get those projects but not necessarily rise in the hierarchy.” Read the cited paper: “Celebrity Couples as Business Families: A Social Network Perspective.” Related topics 	 Research subjects 	 	 Press Release 	 You might also like: Meat substitutes are still tricky to market to consumers despite pandemic growth, Concordia paper finds Trending Concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the Montreal Climate Partnership November 10, 2021 Improvements to Concordia’s Henry F.

Future students Student hub Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search News 15 Concordia disciplines are among the global best The QS World Rankings by Subject 2020 also places the university’s art and design programs in the top 100 internationally March 11, 2020 | By 		Howard Bokser The competition to attract top university students around the world is stiff — and it’s getting increasingly so each year. Yet Concordia continues to keep pace and even step up in its international reputation. In the recently released QS World University Rankings by Subject 2020, Concordia increased the number of its ranked disciplines to 15 — up from 14 in 2019 — out of 48 subjects in total. And Concordia once again made the globe’s top 100 in Art and Design, tying for second among Canadian universities. “I am pleased to see Concordia steadily moving up in international rankings,” says Anne Whitelaw, Concordia’s interim provost and vice-president, academic. “We continue to strengthen the quality of our teaching and research. These rankings show that others are catching on to that reality. This is further confirmation of Concordia’s international reputation and reflects our continuing successful efforts to double our research.” For this year’s survey, QS ranked 1,368 international institutions, 146 more than in 2019. It considered votes collected from global academics and employers between 2015 and 2019. Despite the growing number of institutions this year, Concordia advanced in five subjects: Communication and Media Studies, which also jumped two places to number four in Canada; Computer Science and Information Systems; Economics and Econometrics; English Language and Literature; and Sociology. Concordia was ranked in the subject of Medicine for the first time, placing in the 551-600 spot worldwide. The university maintained its position in four subjects, including Art and Design, where it remained in the 51-100 placement, as well as Business and Management Studies, Education, and Electrical and Electronic Engineering. QS ranked Concordia in three of the five broad subject areas: Arts and Humanities, at 212, up from 230 last year; Engineering and Technology; and Social Sciences and Management.

Information for... Future students Student hub Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search News New rankings recognize Concordia’s strengths in teaching, research, international outlook and graduate employability The university keeps its place among leading higher education institutions despite increased competition October 3, 2019 | By 		Howard Bokser Three preeminent university rankings publications have reaffirmed Concordia’s standing among leading international institutions. In the face of a growing number of schools evaluated, Concordia maintained its position in the 2020 Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings and remained among the world’s top 500 universities in the 2020 QS Graduate Employability Rankings. In the Maclean’s University Rankings 2020, Concordia upheld its 10th-place standing overall among 15 comprehensive universities. Tougher competition In the THE’s 2020 rankings, the university placed in the 601-800 range, the same spot as last year. However, the rankings listed 11 per cent more institutions than the previous year, 1,396 in total compared to 1,258. While Concordia held onto 22nd place in Canada, THE included 30 Canadian universities in 2020, up from 27 last year. The university improved its scores in four of the five areas ranked by THE — teaching, research, citations and international outlook. It dipped slightly in one category, industry income. Furthermore, Concordia’s scores were above the median of all participating institutions for research, citations and international outlook — which was also the university’s best ranking: 151st in the world and 11th in Canada. International outlook factors the ratios of international students and faculty as well as the number of internationally co-authored scholarly papers. Concordia’s score was almost double the global median. “We pride ourselves for our diverse and international faculty and students, as well as our strong partnerships with institutions abroad,” says Anne Whitelaw, Concordia’s interim provost and vice-president, academic. “We believe that diversity only makes us stronger, and it’s gratifying to know that others recognize this reality.” Graduate employability In the 2020 QS Graduate Employability Rankings, Concordia placed in the 301-500 category for the third consecutive year. This ranking compares university performance regarding graduate employability outcomes and prospects. QS evaluated 758 institutions this year, a 15 per cent increase from last year’s 660; QS only publishes results for the top 500 universities. Concordia improved its score in four of five rankings categories: employer reputation, employer-student connections, partnerships with employers and graduate employment rate. In the fifth category, alumni outcomes, Concordia scored almost identically to last year but actually improved its world rank from 225th to 210th — the university’s strongest showing. The alumni outcomes indicator is based on the alma maters of graduates featured in over 150 published high-achievers lists. This year, QS included 16 Canadian universities, one less than last year. “These rankings confirm our strengths in very distinct areas — our teaching, research and international vision, and the employability of our grads — even in an increasingly competitive environment,” Whitelaw says. “We are continually working to improve everything we do and offer at Concordia. These shifts are steadily advancing our global reputation.” Holding steady For the Maclean’s University Rankings 2020, Concordia was listed 10th among 15 comprehensive universities for the fifth consecutive year. The university improved in seven out of the 14 indicators and remained unchanged in four. Its highest rankings were for Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) grants — second among comprehensive universities ­— and library expenses, which saw the largest improvement, moving up three spots to fourth this year. Concordia improved in the following seven indicators: Student awards, from 8th place last year to 6th this year Student/faculty ratio, up one spot to 10th Faculty awards, up one to 12th Citations, up one to 8th Library expenses, up from 7th to 4th Library acquisitions, up one position to 12th Scholarships and bursaries, up one spot to 9th Four indicators remained unchanged: Total research dollars, 10th Operating budget,14th Student services, 13th Reputational survey, 6th Concordia also featured in six of Maclean’s program rankings for all Canadian universities, one more than last year. Three programs improved their rank this year. That included top 10 positions for engineering, at number eight, up from 13; and computer science, at number nine, up from 11. The university’s mathematics program also moved up from 19th to 17th spot. The other highlighted programs were education, ranked 11th, business, 13th, and psychology, 17th.

Information for...   Future students Student hub Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search Home 	 	  /  	 International 	 	  /  	 Academic visitors 	 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn How to come to Concordia as an academic visitor Each year, Concordia welcomes a number of academic visitors from around the world to its campus. ""Academic visitor"" refers to an individual who is not a registered Concordia student or postdoctoral fellow or who does not hold an academic or research appointment covered by the provisions of a collective agreement. There are generally two types of Academic Visitors at Concordia: ""Visiting Scholars"" are faculty members and research fellows at other institutions who are invited to campus by a Concordia faculty member to conduct collaborative research activities. ""Research Interns"" are undergraduate or graduate students who are invited to campus by a Concordia faculty member to conduct collaborative research activities. Activities academic visitors conduct on campus include: Research in collaboration with Concordia faculty Short-term teaching, seminars, lectures, or panels Exhibitions and performances Evaluators for graduate theses, examinations, performances, exhibitions Coming to Concordia as an Academic Visitor In accordance with the Policy on Academic Visitors (VPRGS-10), perspective Academic Visitors to Concordia should follow the steps described on this page. First, a Concordia professor must agree to host you on campus for a specific project and set period of time AND be willing to obtain the necessary approval from her or his department in order for you to be issued an official Letter of Invitation to Concordia. Where applicable, she or he must also be willing to pay the required Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada’s (IRCC) $230 employer compliance fee of $230 using either a Concordia corporate card or their own credit card so that an IRCC Offer of Employment may be issued so you can apply for a work permit.  Concordia University does not cover this fee; the inviting professor is responsible for identifying funding for it and under no circumstances can they ask you to cover or reimburse them for it. If you are unfamiliar with Concordia, the following list of academic units and departments and website for exploring research at Concordia is a good starting point for identifying Concordia professors whose fields of expertise correspond to yours. Please be advised, however, that Concordia professors are not obliged to host academic visitors and Concordia International cannot find a professor to invite you to campus for you. In order for a professor to invite you to campus, she or he will need the following information from you.  We advise that you supply this information to the professor at least six (6) months before your expected arrival date in Canada.   Section 1 of the Academic Visitor Request Form completed. A letter from your home institution indication your affiliation/status there. A copy of your curriculum vitae. A photocopy of your passport page showing personal information (photo, name, date of birth, etc.) if you are not a Canadian citizen or other similar identification document if you are Canadian. If you are a Canadian permanent resident, please also include a copy of your valid permanent resident card.  If you already hold an open temporary work permit authorizing you to work anywhere in Canada for the duration of your visit, please include a copy of the same. If the request is approved by the University, you will receive an official Letter of Invitation (LOI), an Acceptance Form and, where applicable, CIC immigration documents for you to apply for a Temporary Work Permit. Sign and return the Acceptance Form as instructed on and use the other document to begin applying for a Temporary Work Permit. Please don’t apply for a visa or work permit until such time that Concordia provides you with the required documentation. Pre-departure information Immigration: If you are not a Canadian citizen, permanent resident or do not hold an open work permit for the duration of your visit, then you are responsible for obtaining any and all immigration documents required for you to enter Canada and conduct your research project at Concordia. Immigration options to foreign Academic Visitors include: Work Permit Exemptions: 120-day work permit exemption for researchers. For further details, please visit http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/researcher-exemption.asp; 15/30-day work permit exemption for highly skilled workers. For further details, please visit http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/short-term-exemption.asp; Self-funding researcher may be eligible to work without obtaining a work permit if they meet the criteria for the business visitor category: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/permit/business/index.asp. The Business Visitors category also includes foreign professors and researchers seeking entry to Canada to evaluate academic university programs or research proposals as well as Seminar Leaders or Guest Speakers provided the seminar does not last more than five (5) days. Work Permits: according to current regulations, most academic visitors are required to obtain a Temporary Work Permit regardless of whether or not you receive any compensation in Canada. Temporary Work Permits may be based on Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) or Exempted exempt from LMIA requirement. Please be advised that Concordia will not apply for an LMIA for any academic visitor should you not qualify for an exemption. There are several relevant LMIA exemptions for Academic Visitors, including:   Exemption C20: “Canadian interests - Reciprocal employment general”.

Do not confuse the dates you see in the examples in this guide with the actual current term dates and information. Step 1 — Academic advising Academic advising The requirements for advising prior to registration vary according to your program of study. To determine if you require advising refer to the Holds box on your Student Center page or go to your Faculty or School’s advising information page by clicking on the appropriate link below. How to contact your academic advisor: In most cases, you will be assigned an academic advisor for your main plan of study and potentially for any additional plans that you may have. You can easily see the advisor information from the homepage of your student centre: This displays the name of your individual advisor or advising team along with their contact telephone number (if available). If you click on the “details” link, you will see a breakdown of which advisor or advising team relates to each of your plans. If available, and depending on the email program you are using, you can click on the link where the name of the advisor or advising team is shown. This will allow you to email your advisor. If there is no link, then no email address has been provided and you should use the contact phone number to reach your advisor. NOTE: If you are using an internet email client such as Gmail, you can hover the cursor over the link and the email address will be displayed in the bottom left of your screen. Alternatively, depending on the browser you are using, you can right-click on the link and select ‘copy email address’. You may then paste the address into your email client. You can also get more information about advising from the links below:    »  Arts and Science    »  John Molson School of Business    »  Engineering and Computer Science    »  Fine Arts    »  Independent students Step 2 — Accessing registration Register for courses. You can also find the link to register on to the Student Hub's My CU Account page. If you are on a mobile device or a tablet, click the Enroll tile to begin your registration process. If you are using a desktop, you can access the enrolment functions from the left-hand navigation Enrollment dropdown or by clicking on Enroll on the right. Step 3 — Plan your timetable To assist you in planning your timetable we have included information on how to look for courses three different ways: A – Use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder The Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule. B – Use the Class Search You can search for a range of classes based on specific criteria you can define. C – Browse the Course Catalog This is a comprehensive listing of courses offered at Concordia University. Please note the following: Test Results If you plan on registering for English Composition or ESL (English as a Second Language) courses and have written the appropriate placement test, your results will be sent to you by e-mail. REQUISITES Pre-requisites – These are usually either specific classes you must have taken or a minimum amount of credits that you will need to have obtained before you can register for a given class. Co-requisites – These are classes that need to be taken at the same time (or previously) in order to be able to register for a given class. Anti-requisites – These are other classes for which you must not have previously received credit (including any transfer credit or exemptions) in order to be eligible to register for a given class. For example, MARK495 is an anti-requisite of MARK301. To register for MARK301, students should not have previously taken and received credit for MARK495. The reason for these types of requirements are to stop students taking courses out of sequence or taking a higher level course and then trying to take a lower level course that may have similar content. You should consult the Undergraduate Calendar to see the requisites for the course in which you want to register. If you receive a message about ‘requisites not met’ when trying to register for a class, you should ensure that you have met all of the requisites as stated in the Undergraduate Calendar. If you believe that you have then you will need to speak to your department (JMSB students, please contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office) so that they can look into this matter for you. Degree students: You are not permitted to register for a course that has a prerequisite if you have not completed that prerequisite. If you have received authorization from an academic advisor to register for a course without the stated prerequisite, the advisor must enter a waiver that will permit you access to the course. Independent/Visiting students: If you wish to register for courses where the prerequisite was completed elsewhere, you must complete a “Prerequisite Waiver Form” and receive approval prior to registering. Note that you must include specific details of the course, including the course name and number, where and when it was completed, as well as the course description and transcripts. This form is available at the Birks Student Service Centre.   RESERVE SEATS IN CLASSES Some classes have seats that are reserved for students in specific programs. This is usually done to ensure that students who need the class as part of their program are able to register for it. Depending on the rules defined by the department that offers the class, they may set all, some, or none of the seats to be reserved.  If you try to register for a class and receive a message about ‘reserved seats’ then you should select another class or consult the department or the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office, for JMSB students to obtain permission to take the class. DEPARTMENT CONSENT Some classes may require that you first obtain permission to take the class. If you receive a message that states: “Department Consent Required”, you will need to speak to the department that offers the class in order to obtain permission to register. JMSB students will need to contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office.          A — Use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder The Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule. Note that the tool does not register you for any courses but will allow you to add courses directly to your enrollment course cart. You will then need to follow the instructions further down this page in Step 6A – Adding Classes. You can access the Concordia Class Schedule Builder from four different places in your student centre: 1. Student Centre Homepage Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Click the “class schedule builder” link shown in the image below. 2. Class Search Page Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Click the “SEARCH FOR CLASSES” button on the top right of the page. On the Search for Classes page, click the “SEARCH WITH CLASS SCHEDULE BUILDER” button. 3. Enrollment Course Cart page Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Then either click the ‘Enroll’ or ‘enrollment course cart’ links. Then on the next page select the relevant term and click CONTINUE. Once in the enrollment course cart, select the ‘Class Schedule Builder’ option (shown below) and click ‘search’. 4. Class Schedule Page Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre.  Select the ‘Class Schedule’ option from the drop-down list in the Academics section.  Then on the next page select the relevant term and click CONTINUE. On the ‘My Class Schedule’ page, select the ‘View in Class Schedule Builder’ option at the top right. For more information about how to use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder, please watch the instructional video available on the Student Hub.          B — Use the class search The Search for classes function is used to look for information about scheduled classes for a particular term and is generally available in early March. A variety of search criteria may be entered to narrow or broaden a search. Search results provide information such as date and time of classes, location, name of instructor, number of seats available and so on. To search for classes: Select the desired term from the drop-down menu. Term Selection Example: For a Summer class, select “Summer 2021” For a Fall class, select “Fall 2021” For a Winter class, select “Winter 2022” For a Fall / Winter class, select “Fall/Winter 2021-22” (6 credit FULL YEAR classes only) To view classes in all terms of the academic year, select “ALL TERMS (2021-2022) NOTE: Any terms in the list that end in “(CCE Only)” will only return results for Continuing Education classes. Enter search criteria into open fields: Conduct a basic search by entering information into the fields displayed under Class Search Criteria (see Basic Search Criteria table below for more information), or Conduct an advanced search by clicking the Additional Search Criteria fields (see Advanced Search Criteria table below for more information). NOTE: You must enter or select a minimum of two search criteria (in addition to the term selection).   Use the CLEAR button to clear information from the fields and enter new search criteria. Click the SEARCH button to retrieve results. View information returned on the Search Results page: If you are searching in a term in which you have already enrolled, your “My Class Schedule” will be displayed. A summary of the search criteria entered List of classes that meet the search criteria, including class details, class name and number, section, location, days, times, instructor, term offered, availability, and status. New search criteria can be entered by clicking the NEW SEARCH or MODIFY SEARCH button If a class in the search results is offered in a career and term that you are active in, then you will be able to use the “select” button next to the class to add it to your Course Cart. For example, if you are in an undergraduate program but search for a graduate class, the select button will not appear. If you are already enrolled in a class or a class is already in your enrollment course cart, the “select” button will not appear.   BASIC SEARCH CRITERIA Term The “Term” drop down refers to the term for which you are searching for class(es). Course Career The “Course Career” drop-down menu allows you to select if you want to search for classes offered to Undergraduates, Graduates, Professional Development (GradProSkills), Research, or classes in Continuing Education. Select Subject The green “select subject” button provides an alphabetical listing of all class subjects that have been offered historically (these may not currently be offered). If you already know the abbreviation of the Class Subject, type it into the blank field beside the “select subject” button. For example, type “ENGL” for English classes, or “FINA” for Finance classes. Course Number The “Course Number” field narrows the search down further to a specific class. For example, if you want to search for the POLI 202 class, you would enter “POLI” in the ‘Select Subject’ field above and then enter “202” into the ‘Course Number’ field. Course Level The “Course Level” field allows you to search for classes at a specific level. You can select multiple levels if you wish to view a larger range of results. For example, if you want to view all 200-level classes, select the “200” checkbox. If you want to view all 500 and 600-level classes, select both the “500” and “600” checkboxes. NOTE: The Course Level option can only be used for credit courses. This can be combined with the ‘Select subject’ field or the ‘Department or Faculty’ field to refine results. Department or Faculty The “Department or Faculty” field allows you to search for classes offered by a specific department or faculty. For example, to search for classes offered by the Education department, select “Education” from the drop-down menu. To search for classes offered by the Fine Arts faculty, select “FACULTY OF FINE ARTS” from the drop-down menu. NOTE: When searching for classes offered by a Faculty, you may have to refine your search by selecting additional criteria. . ADDITIONAL SEARCH CRITERIA Class Times The “Class Times” field refers to the class start and end times. Entering a time in the first field will search for all classes starting after the time entered. Entering a time in the second field will search for all classes ending before the time entered. These fields can be used together to search for classes within a desired range. NOTE: The times should be entered in a 24-hour format. For example, if you wish to search for 7am, enter “07.00”, or for 7pm, enter “19.00”. Days of the week You can select any of the checkboxes next to the relevant day(s) of the week to include classes offered on that day in the search. NOTE: If you select a specific day, the search results will include classes that are scheduled on that day, including any classes that are split between the selected day and another day. For example, if you select the “Mon” checkbox only, you will see classes scheduled on a Monday only and classes scheduled on a Monday and Wednesday. Location You can use the “Location” field to search for any combination of ‘in-person’ classes scheduled at the ‘Sir George Williams (Downtown)’ or ‘Loyola’ campuses, or for ‘Online Courses. NOTE: If you search only for Online classes, then any Class Times entered or Days of Week selected will be ignored. Instructor Last Name Search for classes taught by a specific instructor by entering the first few letters, the exact last name, or letters contained in the name. Course Keyword Search for a class by its title and description. Enter a full or partial keyword to return search results that include all classes with the keyword or partial keyword as part of the title or description. Class Nbr Enter the ‘Class Nbr’ if known. This is a 4 or 5-digit class number that a class is assigned in the Student Information System. NOTE: This is not the same number as the “Course Number” field above. Mode of Instruction There are three modes of instruction at Concordia: In Person – In Person courses are taught in-person on a Concordia campus. On-Line – On-line courses are taught online and not in a classroom setting. Blended Learning – Blended Learning courses are a combination of in-class and online learning. Class times, locations and specific dates listed in Days/Times and Start/End Date fields will indicate which in-class meetings are required. For more information, please see the notes tab or contact the department.          C — Browse course catalog The Browse Course Catalog feature provides access to a comprehensive listing of information about courses offered at Concordia University.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Search > Browse Course Catalog To browse for courses: Course List provides the opportunity to look for a particular course subject by selecting the first letter of the subject of the course: Selecting a letter brings up a list of matching course subjects. Selecting a particular course subject will display a list of courses available. Important Note:  the existence of a course on this list does not guarantee that the course is currently offered. If you click on the “Course Nbr” or “Course Title” column you will be able to see the course details: The Course Detail page will identify whether or not the course has been scheduled. If it is scheduled, you will be able to “view class sections” to learn how many sections are available and when they are offered. If a course does not have a description, please refer to the undergraduate academic calendar for further details regarding the course. Selecting the View Class Sections link displays the term in which you are considering taking the course and you can see whether or not it is being offered. Step 4 — Enrollment appointment dates The enrollment appointment date is the first date on which you may begin the registration process for that term. Your individual date will be displayed in the Enrollment Dates box on your Student Center page. Example: Although the enrollment appointment dates indicate when you will be able to start registering, you can start planning and filling your Course Cart in early March.  The enrollment appointment date is based on the number of credits to completion for your program if you are a degree student. If you wish to calculate your enrollment appointment date, the following formula is used: Program length (minimum credits required) minus credits earned minus in progress courses as of February 2019 (excluding DISC courses) equals credits to completion. Following are all the enrollment appointment dates for 2021-22: Enrollment appointment dates Summer 2021 (term number 2211) Fall 2021 (term number 2212) Fall/Winter 2021 - 22 (term number 2213) Winter 2022 (term number 2214)   Enrollment Appointment Date Credits to completion or category of student March 9 0 to 9 credits + COOP Students, Varsity Students March 10 10 to 21 credits March 11 22 to 33 credits March 12 34 to 42 credits March 15 43 to 54 credits March 16 55 to 63 credits March 17 64 to 72 credits March 18 73 to 87 credits March 19 88 and more credits March 22 Visiting undergraduate students, returning and newly authorized undergraduate Independent students for Summer 2021 (term number 2211) April 20 Visiting Students – for Fall / Winter April 20 Newly admitted undergraduate students registering for Fall 2021 (term number 2212), Fall/Winter 2021-22 (term number 2213) and Winter 2022 (term number 2214) terms Students admitted for Fall 2021 (term number 2212) should register for Fall 2021 (term number 2212) and Winter 2022 (term number 2214) courses at the same time. August 2 Returning and newly authorized undergraduate Independent students for Fall 2021 (term number 2212). September 21 New undergraduate students admitted for Winter 2022 (term number 2214) can register any time after admission and advising criteria have been satisfied November 25 Newly authorized undergraduate Independent students for Winter 2022 (term number 2214) Step 5 — System availability On the enrollment appointment dates, the system is programmed to be available from 8 a.m. onward. The registration system may be extremely busy at 8 a.m. on each new enrollment appointment date. Step 6 — Registration While departmental and faculty advisors and staff are always available to give advice and guidance, you are responsible for the completeness and correctness of your course selection and registration, and for observing the University’s regulations and deadlines.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > My Academics If the information concerning your program is incorrect you may contact 514-848-2424, ext. 2668 to find out how to make corrections. It is important for this information to be correct, as the wrong degree or concentration may block you from entering courses for which you are eligible. Address Verification – On the Student Center page, you will see your current address. If you need to correct your address or any other piece of personal information, click on the relevant area under the Personal Information banner and you will be redirected to another screen where you can make the necessary changes. Please note that you are responsible for providing the University with your current mailing and e-mail address. You are required to fulfill all financial and administrative obligations within the prescribed deadlines regardless of the validity of your address in our files. Student Hub > Get to know your self-service portal          A — Adding classes You can add classes to your schedule for the selected term in three easy steps with a couple of restrictions to note: If you have a financial hold you will not be able to register in classes until you clear the hold. Classes can only be added until the add/drop deadline for a given term. For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Add Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection. Click the Continue button.   Find a class to add, using one of the options displayed, or, if you know the class number, enter it into the Enter Class Nbr field Class Schedule Builder – refer to Step 3 A – Use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder above if you need further help. Class Search – refer to Step 3 B – Use the Class Search above if you need further help. To view details of the course, click on the Section to obtain further information about the course. If satisfied that you wish to enroll in this course, choose “select”. Confirm the class information. If the section selected also requires you to register for additional components such as labs, tutorials, conferences, etc. you will be required to make that choice before proceeding further: Once you have selected the conference, press Next.  You will receive confirmation that the course has been added to your Course Cart. NOTE: Having a course added to your Course Cart does not mean that you are registered in the course. You must click on ‘Proceed to Step 2 of 3’ OR  ‘enroll’ in order to go to the final confirmation page. At this point, you may continue to add further courses to your Course Cart. Once you have added all your required courses, you will need to click on the “Proceed To Step 2 of 3” button. If your registration was successful you will see the following message: If it was unsuccessful you will receive an error explaining what the problem is and what you must do to rectify the situation. Here is just one possible example: For Example, the above message is informing you that Departmental Consent is required before you can register in this course. It would be necessary for you to contact the relevant Department to obtain the necessary consent. In other instances, you may be denied registration in a course that appears to have seats available. This is caused by the Department/Faculty having reserved seats for students in a particular department or program of study. Remember to register for all terms Summer (2191), Fall (2192), Fall/Winter (2193) and Winter (2194) at the same time – do not wait until later in the Fall to register for your Winter courses as you may find them filled to capacity.          B — Dropping classes Please note: If you only want to change sections of the same course see Step 6, C – Swapping classes. There are three easy steps to dropping a class from your schedule but there are two different types of course withdrawals and both are controlled by deadline dates shown in the Term Dates and Deadlines. Please note the following important details: DNE – did not enter – The DNE date is generally one to two weeks after the first day of classes. A withdrawal (drop) before the DNE deadline date is treated as if you were never in the course. There will be no entry on your student record for that course and you will not be charged tuition and other fees for that course. If you have already paid for the course, you will receive financial credit for course fees. DISC – discontinue – The DISC date is later in the term. A withdrawal (drop) after the DNE date, but before the DISC deadline date allows you to stop attending that course with no academic penalty. Unlike the DNE, however, the course will remain on your student record with an entry of DISC and you will be held financially responsible for the payment of 100% of tuition and other fees, including the Winter portion of a full-year course. Not attending classes, or informing an instructor of an intent to withdraw, does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does it entitle a student to a refund of fees or cancellation of registration. Without formally dropping the course by the appropriate academic withdrawal deadline, non-attendance of a class will result in the assignment of a failing grade. If you enroll in a fall term course that is a prerequisite for a winter course and later drop the fall course, the Faculty/Department involved will run a process at the beginning of the winter term to ensure that all students registered in a course with prerequisites have successfully completed that prerequisite. Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed, you will not have the option to select that term. If you have a financial hold, you will be able to drop classes, but you will not be able to add classes. If you intend to replace a dropped class with a new class, ensure that all financial holds are cleared. For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Drop NOTE: If you receive an error message stating “You are not authorized for self service enrollment at this time” when you click on the Drop tab, you will need to click the “change term” button and then follow the steps below. Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table. Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection from the table. Click the Continue button. All registered classes for the term will be displayed in a grid. Multi-component classes will display all registered sections. Select the class(es) you want to drop and click the Drop Selected Classes button. Note that you are able to drop multiple courses at once if you wish to do so. Select the My class Schedule button to retrieve your class schedule and confirm that the class(es) are no longer shown OR if they are, that they correctly show the status as Dropped or DSC.          C — Swapping classes (including Section changes) You can swap one course for another or one section for a different one. The process is a combination of add and drop. The swap function allows you to verify the availability of another course or section of the same course before you make a decision. There is, therefore, no risk of losing the section you have if another section is not available.  DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, use the drop and add features to accomplish a section change. If you drop the section that you are currently registered for and then find out that no spaces are available in other sections, you may not be able to get back into the section you were originally registered in as another student may have taken your place once you dropped the course. There are some restrictions attached to swapping classes: If you have a financial hold you will not be able to swap any classes until you clear the hold. Classes can only be swapped until the add/drop deadline for a given term.  For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page. If you are not enrolled in any classes you will not have access to swap classes. The swap feature should not be used to swap between summer classes in different summer sessions. For example, do not use it to swap from a May to June course into a June to August course or from a full summer (May to August) course into either a May to June course or a June to August course. To swap a component of a multi-component class while keeping one or more of the other components (for example, swap HIST 202 Lec A, Conf AA for HIST 202 Lec A, Conf BB while keeping the same lecture) see the section entitled Swapping Multi-Component Classes.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Swap Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table. Click the Continue button. The first grid on this page called, Swap This Class, displays a list of classes in which you are currently enrolled. The next section, called With This Class, allows you to search for a class using the class search feature, or to select from your Course Cart, or to enter the Class Nbr if you already know it. Select the class that you wish to swap from with the Swap This Class grid. Select the class that you want to swap to using the With This class grid. If you use the search feature and identify a course, you will be asked to choose the section you want by using the “select class” button and you are then re-directed to the Confirm your selection page. If you Select from your Course Cart, using the select button next to that option takes you to the Confirm your selection page. If you use the Enter Class Nrb feature and press enter you will eventually reach the Confirm your selection page. Confirm your selection and click the Finish Swapping button. If the swap is unsuccessful either follow the instructions in the error message or try another course by selecting SWAP from the menu bar: View My Class Schedule to verify the status of your swap transaction: Swapping multi-component classes (while keeping one or more of the other components) Search for the class using the search function in the With this class grid. You will be prompted to make a selection for all required components even if you want to keep the same sections in which you are already enrolled. Confirm your selection. All related components of a class will be displayed. Verify the swap transaction. View My Class Schedule to ensure that the class has been swapped in your registration. PLEASE NOTE – If you try to swap one of your components for another one that is currently on a waitlist, then you will be placed on the waitlist for ALL components of the class and potentially lose your place in the class. If you do not want to take this risk, then do not use the swap feature to swap components if your preferred component is on a waitlist. For example: You are currently enrolled in COMP248 Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X. You want to stay in Lecture U and Laboratory UI-X, but swap the tutorial for U UB (which is on a waitlist). If you attempt to do this using a swap, you will lose your existing places in Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X and be placed on the waitlist for Lecture U, Tutorial U UB and Laboratory UI-X.          D — Wait listing classes Once all seats in a course have been filled it may still be possible for you to add your name to a wait list. Academic departments have the choice of offering wait list seats or not. To determine which courses will allow you to add your name to a wait list:    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Search Select the term Select the subject Select the course number Search Once the results of the search are displayed, click on the Section hyperlink: You are now on the Class Detail page which indicates whether or not a Wait List is available for the course selected and it is also indicated what the wait list capacity is for the course and the Wait List total. This tells you that 80 students can add their name to a wait list after the class capacity of 770 has been reached. There are two scenarios under which you may add your name to a wait list. You have not yet enrolled in your maximum course load so that if a seat becomes available you would be eligible to add it to your other courses for that term. You have enrolled in your maximum course load but you set-up your name on a wait list using the swap feature so that if a seat does become available, you would swap one course for another. Scenario 1 You start the registration process by trying to register for ECON 201 but the course is full and you get the following error message: You use the class search described above to see the detail of the course and determine that a wait list is available and that there is still room for you to add your name. Knowing this, you select the course again and tick the box labelled Wait list if class is full and select next. You will see the resulting message: If a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be registered automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty. Scenario 2 If you are permitted to enroll in 15 credits in the fall term and you have already reached that capacity but still want the possibility of entering INTE 123, you would use the Swap This Class grid to identify which of your courses you would swap. You would then go to the With This Class grid and enter the course. You will then follow the normal steps to get to the point where you identify that you want to “Wait list if class is full”. If a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be swapped from one course to the other automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty. Some tips about wait lists You can wait list for a maximum of 6 units per term. You cannot be wait listed for two sections of the same course. You can remove your name from a wait list by using the drop feature. Note: Adding your name to a waitlist does NOT guarantee that you will get into the class. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are on a waitlist for a course, it does not mean that you are actually registered for the course. You will only be registered into the course if a seat becomes available and the system registers you into the class based on your waitlist position. Step 7 — Verify your courses You can verify your schedule in two different formats. From your Student Center page you can choose weekly schedule. The resulting “My Class Schedule” page allows you to select the term for which you wish to verify your registrations. After selecting the term, press continue. You then have the choice of seeing your schedule in a list view or a weekly calendar view. The list view is as follows: The weekly calendar view is as follows: PLEASE NOTE: The weekly calendar view of your class schedule will not show any classes that occur on a national or university holiday. Any online classes that you are enrolled in will appear at the bottom of the calendar.   The Concordia Class Schedule Builder view is as below: Once you have selected the term in the Concordia Class Schedule Builder, you will see the classes that you are enrolled in, are on the waitlist for, or have in your enrollment course cart. Step 8 — How to obtain help If you encounter faculty-related difficulties (prerequisites, co-requisites, anti-requisites; permission of the department required; closed class, etc.) while using the Registration system, you must contact your department. Please refer to the following links:    »  Arts and Science    »  John Molson School of Business    »  Engineering and Computer Science    »  Fine Arts For non Faculty-related problems, please call 514-848-2424, ext. 2668 Monday to Friday, from 09:00 – 17:00, all year round, except for holidays. Should you experience technical difficulties, please contact the Concordia Service Desk at: By phone: 514-848-2424, ext. 7613 Via email at: help@concordia.ca By opening a ticket Please note that the Service Desk cannot assist you directly with any issues you are having registering for classes. You should contact your advisor or department or, for JMSB students, the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office initially and they will then contact the Service Desk on your behalf if it is an issue they are unable to resolve. Step 9 — Obtain your account balance and verify payment deadlines Information regarding your account balance is available from the Student Center page under the Finances banner: Payment Deadlines: Due Now – this is the amount that you owe for the tuition and fees for the current term. An amount may show as ‘Due now’ before the final payment deadline. For example, the tuition fees for a Fall term are generally due at the beginning of September but you are allowed until the end of September to pay them without financial penalty. These fees will show as ‘Due Now’ in your Student Centre from the beginning of September. Future Due – this is the amount that you will have to pay for the upcoming term(s), including tuition and fees for classes you have enrolled in for any upcoming term(s). For example, if you are enrolling in Winter classes before the beginning of January, the tuition fees for these classes will show as ‘Future Due’ in your Student Centre until the beginning of January.   PLEASE NOTE – if you have recently enrolled or dropped some classes and you would like to see your updated tuition balance, you can click on the “Account Inquiry” link in the top-left of the Finances section.  This will trigger a recalculation of your tuition fees and update your balance accordingly.

October 2 to 5: Get training, complete challenges and win prizes! September 25, 2018 | By S. Baker UPDATE: Due to weather conditions, the BBQ scheduled for October 2 will now take place October 3 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. In addition, the October 4 training session at the Loyola Campus has been cancelled. Do you know what to do in case of an emergency on campus? What about a hazardous waste spill in a lab? From October 2 to 5, Concordia will be holding its second Campus Safety Awareness Week to draw attention to these types of issues and how best to respond in an emergency situation. As part of the continuing campaign, Campus Safety: Be Informed, Get Connected, this year Concordia’s Security Team has joined forces with Environmental Health and Safety and IT Services. Hot topics will not only include physical safety, but also IT security and safe practices in the lab and workplace. October 2: Kiosks and a BBQ Ever wonder what it would be like to wear a haz-mat suit or how long it would take to put on a fire fighter’s uniform? On October 2, between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., you’ll get your chance. Come to the Henry F. Hall (H) Building terrace and check out kiosks, gather useful safety information, enjoy some freebies and undertake the fire fighter and security challenges. You can also enter to win one of two $50 pre-paid credit card prizes. If you have Alertus + mobile app downloaded on your phone, you can even get free hotdogs and a drink. Alertus + Alertus + is a free alert system that sends push notifications to the university community during significant incidents — like, say, campus-wide closures after a 40-centimetre snowfall. The app is available for iOS, Android and Blackberry 10.2.1 or later and can be downloaded from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. It’s quick to install, takes minimal storage and the data transfer is negligible. Once downloaded, make sure to enter the organization code “concordia” or the app won’t work. Don’t forget to keep this app up to date so that it functions properly in an emergency situation.  October 3 to 4: Training and info sessions Become CERTified Want to become a member of the Concordia Emergency Response Team (CERT)? On Wednesday, October 3 from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., a certification session will be taking place in room CD on the 9th floor of the John Molson (MB) Building on Sir George Williams Campus. A training will also take place on Loyola Campus on Thursday, October 4 from 1 to 4 p.m. in room 110 of the Loyola Jesuit Hall and Conference Centre (RF Building). The CERT is made up of Concordia staff and student volunteers that assist during evacuations and other emergencies that may occur on campus. There are no shifts or off-campus commitments. Team members go about their regular activities on campus and only assume their CERT responsibilities in the event of an emergency in the building they are in. As a CERT volunteer you will receive free CPR/first aid training and certificates, fire prevention training and CERT training. You can also request a confirmation letter for voluntary service. Learn about emergencies We don’t plan to fail, but we often fail to plan. At an institutional level, Concordia undertakes preparedness and prevention activities to deal with a variety of different emergency situations. Concordia’s Security Team encourages students, faculty and staff to do so as well. Would you know what to do in an emergency situation? Come learn some tips and tricks from Concordia’s security experts on Wednesday, October 3 from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. in room CD on the 9th floor of the MB Building. A subsequent seminar takes place on Thursday, October 4 from 10 to 11 a.m. in room 110 of the RF Building. Brush up on IT Security From banking to shopping, most of our day-to-day transactions can now be accomplished with the click of a mouse. While convenient, this also makes our personal information vulnerable. Come learn some valuable tips and tricks from Concordia’s IT security experts on how to keep your information private, avoid internet scams and keep your computers and cellphones safe. Information sessions will be taking place on Wednesday, October 3 from 9 to 10 a.m. and 1 to 2 p.m. in room F on the 9th floor of the MB Building. A subsequent information session will take place on Thursday, October 4 from 9 to 10 a.m. and 1 to 2 p.m. in room 130 of the RF Building. October 5: Alertus + seminar Alertus and Concordia will be teaming up on Friday, October 5 to host a seminar entitled, Developing a Holistic Approach to Emergency Management and Response.

Information for... Future students Student hub Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search News Concordia is once again named best university in North America under 50 Top marks are also awarded for its allure for international students, faculty citations, communications, engineering and more July 15, 2020 | By 		Howard Bokser Concordia was created in August 1974 after two esteemed Montreal institutions, Sir George Williams University and Loyola College, joined forces. Just over 45 years later, the university is still relatively young — Oxford University, for instance, is closing in on its first millennium. Despite its youth — or maybe because of it — Concordia has quickly evolved into a vibrant, next-generation university. It was again rated as the best institution of higher education in Canada less than five decades old by two recently released rankings. The QS Top 50 Under 50 2021 ranked Concordia number one in North America for the second year running and placed it in the 61–70 range in the world for the third consecutive year. Concordia also ranked number one in Canada and held its 101-150 spot out of 414 universities worldwide under 50 years old in the Times Higher Education (THE) Young University Rankings 2020. It placed in the same grouping last year but among a smaller number of universities (351). Best under 50 The QS list includes both the Top 50 under 50 and the Next 100 under 50, and it assesses the world’s leading universities founded after 1970. Concordia is the only North American school present. The QS Top 50 under 50 is derived from the pool of all institutions in the newly released QS World University Rankings 2021. Concordia placed among the top 41 per cent out of the 1,002 ranked international institutions, 477th overall, and remained in 17th spot among 26 Canadian universities for the third year in a row. Concordia improved its scores from the previous year in two QS categories, citations and international students. The latter, which measures how attractive universities are to students around the world, was Concordia’s best showing — the university ranked 104th globally, up seven spots from last year. The median for the international student ratio per 100 students is 10.6, while Concordia’s ratio is three times higher at 32.5.  The university remained one of three in Canada that placed in the THE Young University Rankings 2020, which are based on the 2020 World University Rankings released in September 2019. It improved from last year on four out of the five measures: teaching, research, citations and international outlook.  “Concordia is still young by international standards, and we are clearly recognized as a next-generation university that adopts, for instance, fresh approaches to our research,” says Anne Whitelaw, interim provost and vice-president, academic. “With more than 9,600 students from 150 countries outside Canada, we’ve undoubtedly earned our outstanding reputation among those from around the world, even during these difficult times.” Recognition for engineering disciplines Concordia also fared well in two other recently released international rankings. The 2020 edition of the Shanghai Ranking’s Global Ranking of Academic Subjects (GRAS) included Concordia in 18 subjects, one more than last year. Concordia placed in the top 100 in the world in three GRAS subjects: Telecommunication Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Automation and Control. The university tied for first in Canada along with three others in Communication. The GRAS ranks more than 4,000 universities in 54 subjects across five broad subject fields: natural sciences, engineering, life sciences, medical sciences and social sciences.  Concordia’s ranked subjects included Environmental Science and Engineering for the first time this year. The university also improved its scores in six subjects: Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Telecommunication Engineering, Civil Engineering, Energy Science and Engineering, Communication, and Management. Finally, Concordia placed in the top three per cent of 20,000 institutions worldwide evaluated for the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) 2020-21. The university maintained its 22nd position out of 44 Canadian universities and placed 586th out of 2,000 ranked universities. Concordia’s highest CWUR position was for the alumni employment indicator, which measures the number of a university’s graduates who currently hold CEO positions at the world’s top companies, relative to the university’s size.  To see the full rankings visit: QS Top 50 Under 50 2021, Times Higher Education’s Young University Rankings 2020, Shanghai Ranking’s Global Ranking of Academic Subjects and the Center for World University Rankings 2020-21.     Related topics 	 teaching 	 	 engineering 	 	 accolades 	 	 rankings 	 	 international 	 	 communication 	 You might also like: Concordia places in the world’s top 20 in 2 categories in the 2020 Times Higher Education Impact Rankings 15 Concordia disciplines are among the global best New rankings recognize Concordia’s strengths in teaching, research, international outlook and graduate employability Trending Concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the Montreal Climate Partnership November 10, 2021 Improvements to Concordia’s Henry F.
