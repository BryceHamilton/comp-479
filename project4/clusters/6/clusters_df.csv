romani contexts” supports the adaptation and revision of existing courses and the creation of new courses taught in the translation studies sector of the département d’études françaises by professor folaron. these courses are offered at concordia university during the following terms: winter 2021  fall 2021  winter 2022  fall 2022  winter 2023  winter 2021 ftra 601/ftra 539* courants contemporains | contemporary trends in translation studies this graduate seminar course, offered in english, explores some of the contemporary research trends in translation studies, with a special focus on multilingual, minoritized, migrant, european/eu, and technology contexts. their translation practices and conceptual frameworks, guided by the specificities of their social and political situations and histories, allow us to rethink translational linguistic and cultural transfer in all its complexity. students examine the ways that the european union implements its multilingual policies and translation strategies in order to encourage representative and participatory democracy. they also explore the dynamics that influence communication and translation practices in other linguistically diverse environments, in particular those of minoritized and endangered languages-cultures — with a special focus on indigenous, migrant, and romani contexts. a number of factors contribute to linguistic-cultural (in)stability: economics; warfare; geopolitics; sociocultural and linguistic traditions and habits; migration; demographics; political and institutional ideologies. in our rapidly transforming contemporary world, the forces challenging us are many: globalization, social inequalities, economic and climatic unsustainability, political governance, technological automation and artificial intelligence. to understand them critically is to begin to re-envision future directions for our human trajectory. as a vital means of communication across geographical and digital boundaries, and rich in the experience of negotiating difference, translation will continue to have a significant role to play. *offered as ftra 603/ftra 553 translation and socio-political contexts in 2022 and 2023 see the full syllabus ftra 668/ftra 568/ftra 418* web, technologies, and translation – theories and critiques this graduate/undergraduate seminar course, offered in english, considers the practices that have been emerging from the convergence of contemporary technologies, the multilingual web, the digital world, and translation. while translation is one of the oldest communication practices in the world, it is also very much a product of its times. students examine the various aspects and issues that the digital world brings to the translation landscape, and vice versa. on the one hand, flows of digital information and communication move through technologies across borders in our globalizing world. on the other hand, these digital flows collide with geographical and political boundaries, forcing diverse stake­holders (governments, institutions, organizations, companies, civil society) to deal with physical borders and concepts in a digital space and ecosystem. these trends, accelerated by myriad automated processes, algorithms, and artificial intelligence, have a major impact on translation as well - including machine translation. taken together, information and communication technologies (icts), mobile devices, the internet and web are an integral, ubiquitous, pervasive, and guiding force in today's cultures and societies. as our societies are increasingly transformed into multi-level digital societies, they challenge us to think beyond easily constructed categories or simplified concepts, and raise important questions. ‘who' is accountable for ‘what' within the networked complexity of digital ecosystems? to what extent are automated agents and apps (including for machine translation) responsible for the content they generate? how does the increasing digitalization of our markets, economies, and notions of work affect social and political integration, government policies, governance, and citizenship? what is the role of ai ethics? throughout this course, the multilingual context of the european union serves as fertile ground for exploring and discussing these pertinent questions and issues. *offered as ftra 668/568/418 “web, technologies, translation” in 2022 and 2023 see the full syllabus ftra 698/ftra 598* special topics: eu language policy and translation policy this graduate “special topics” seminar course, offered in english, presents a brief historical overview of the european union, with emphasis on the basic principles of eu language policy and translation policy. it introduces the concepts that underpin the creation and development of the european union and its role in the world today, including its relationship to canada through the recent eu-canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement (ceta). students discuss the challenges of european multilingualism, and its management through the official language and translation policies implemented within the eu and its diverse institutions. equal consideration is given to the role of the european charter for regional or minority languages (ecrml) and its support for minoritized languages and minority language translation. the complexities of a multilingual minority context are exemplified by the linguistic-translational situation of romani peoples, who collectively comprise europe's largest ethnic minority and reside as citizens within multiple nation-state borders, with literacy in different languages. by way of comparison with the canadian context, students examine the various means by which translation is currently carried out in the multilingual eu context, e.g., by human and machine translation, and with internal and external translation services managed by the directorate-general for translation (dgt). also examined are the “competence” skill-sets and levels that are provided by the common european framework of reference for languages (cefr) and the european master's in translation (emt), among others. lastly, students look at some of the digital transformations occurring within the contemporary eu, and consider e-democracy and ai initiatives in terms of the conceptual frameworks by which the european union was founded. *offered as ftra 698/598 “special topics: eu language policy and translation policy” in 2022 and 2023 see the full syllabus fall 2021 ftra 603/ftra 553 contextes socio-politiques de la traduction | translation in sociopolitical context this graduate seminar course explores and examines the social and political contexts that influence translation and translator practices. diverse perspectives are considered: bilingual and multilingual social situations; political structures and language policies; the unique dynamics and specificities of minoritized linguistic and cultural contexts in translation; the role of ethics; migration; translation in the european union; and new and emerging translation markets and areas of research for minoritized language groups. the translation practices and conceptual research frameworks of these contexts, when examined in relation to their social and political situations and histories, allow us to rethink translational dynamics in all its complexity. see the full syllabus winter 2022 ftra 668/ftra 568/ftra 418* web, technologies, and translation – theories and critiques this graduate/undergraduate

(ecrml) and its support for minoritized languages and minority language translation. the complexities of a multilingual minority context are exemplified by the linguistic-translational situation of romani peoples, who collectively comprise europe's largest ethnic minority and reside as citizens within multiple nation-state borders, with literacy in different languages. by way of comparison with the canadian context, students examine the various means by which translation is currently carried out in the multilingual eu context, e.g., by human and machine translation, and with internal and external translation services managed by the directorate-general for translation (dgt). also examined are the “competence” skill-sets and levels that are provided by the common european framework of reference for languages (cefr) and the european master's in translation (emt), among others. lastly, students look at some of the digital transformations occurring within the contemporary eu, and consider e-democracy and ai initiatives in terms of the conceptual frameworks by which the european union was founded. *offered as ftra 698/598 “special topics: eu language policy and translation policy” in 2022 and 2023 the course syllabus will be posted at the start of the new term. fall 2022 the course syllabi will be posted at the start of the new term. winter 2023 the course syllabi will be posted at the start of the new term. the european commission's support for the production of this publication does not constitute an endorsement of the contents, which reflect the views only of the

administered to a person, improves the ability of their immune system to fight germs that cause a disease. therefore, vaccines can prevent certain illnesses, some of which are life-threatening. keeping your vaccines up-to-date will help you stay healthy all year long. while vaccination is not mandatory in canada, concordia university health services strongly recommends everyone keep their vaccinations up-to-date. unfortunately, many concordians have not received all the vaccines that are recommended by public health experts. outbreaks of vaccine-preventable

page feeds in some cases, emergency information is available via a yellow banner at the top of the concordia.ca main page and/or on the concordia app. alerts can also appear on the emergency preparedness page. building public address systems most large buildings at concordia have a public address system (p.a.) as part of a building's fire alarm.  the building p.a. system will be used to communicate information concerning an emergency situation to building occupants.  if the fire alarm is heard, this is a signal to evacuate immediately, do not wait for the p.a. message to confirm an evacuation. updating your personal contact information staff and faculty members the emergency notification system utilizes the contact information that you have provided in your human resources profile.  it is your responsibility to keep your office location and contact information up to date.  the system will import all the contact information you choose to provide; cell phone, home phone,

you have any questions concerning the emergency notification system, please e-mail us at emergency.management@concordia.ca more on updating your personal information emergency notification strategy in most cases, notifications and information concerning emergencies on campus will be disseminated in a timely and consistently fashion with accurate information.  this is why we encourage the community to be aware of the different emergency notification channels available to them and to review emergency procedures to be well informed and prepared when and emergency occurs on campus. there are some emergencies however that can be a matter of life and death and do not give us the luxury of time to craft consistent messages with accurate information. a fire alarm is a good example of how building occupants receive a notification via alarm bells without being provided any details as to where the fire may be or what exactly is burning.  because it is potentially a life and death situation, the importance is alerting building occupants to the danger and getting them to safety as quickly as possible. there are other situations like this where a serious threat to the life and safety of people on campus may present itself but the specific details as to the exact location and/or the exact nature of the threat is not immediately known. for example, active shooter or armed intruder events are initially very chaotic and confusing.  the ability of authorities to respond, understand what is happening, assess where the threats are and who is most at risk is nearly impossible within the first 30 minutes.  in these cases, like a fire alarm, the emphasis must be placed on alerting those who are potentially at risk as quickly as possible. the strategy is to interrupt people caught up in their daily activities, tell them they are potentially in danger to trigger their individual survival instinct.  once triggered, the individual can figure out if they are in immediate danger and take the necessary steps to protect themselves.  this is why at concordia, if a serious threat to the life and safety of people on campus due to an armed intruder, a very basic emergency alert will be sent to the entire campus within seconds; concordia emergency alert:  armed intruder at sgw campus – if on campus, seek a secure location immediately, if not on sgw campus, stay away and await further instructions. the purpose of the campus alert is to advise the campus community as quickly as possible that a dangerous situation is unfolding and everyone should stop what they are doing and assess their own situation and react accordingly.(see the active shooter - armed intruder procedure) always keep in mind that the emergency may be occurring in your building, a neighbouring building or across campus.  if you assess that nothing is happening around and you are safe, remain where you are until you have more information as to the specific nature and location of the emergency or if your situation changes.   as soon as more information becomes available and is confirmed, subsequent emergency notification messages will be sent, providing more details such as to the exact nature and location of the emergency to help building occupants determine what course of action they should take.   contact us 514-848-3717 dial 1 for urgent situations dial 2 for non-urgent situations security

romani studies scholar will be tasked with promoting eu studies for the next 3 years october 6, 2020 | by alexander hackett debbie folaron: “bringing the unique romani context into our practices and reflections on translation studies is an integral part of what led to this inaugural chair at concordia.” no concordia professor has ever been awarded the jean monnet chair by the european union — until now. debbie folaron, a specialist in multilingual and romani translation practices in the département d’études françaises, has become the university’s first-ever faculty to hold the three-year post. the chair is aligned with her project “multiple roles of translation in minority multilingual romani contexts (romtra).” the prestigious position is designed to promote excellence in teaching and research in the field of eu studies worldwide. “on behalf of the faculty of arts and science, i congratulate dr. folaron on this outstanding accomplishment,” says pascale sicotte, dean and professor of biology. “we are eager to see the many synergies that are sparked through this exciting project.” only two jean monnet chairs were awarded to universities across canada this year. the position’s teaching and research activities focus on many different aspects of the eu, such as policy, citizenship, education and technology, among others, folaron explains. “they are designed to encourage intercultural understanding and dialogue between diverse peoples and cultures as a path to eu inclusion and integration,” she says. “translation, with its multiple roles in minority contexts, is a means with which to do just that. bringing the unique romani context into our practices and reflections on translation studies is an integral part of what led to this inaugural chair at concordia.” recipients must provide 90 hours of courses per academic year for three consecutive years to deepen the teaching of eu studies in a university’s official curriculum. “dr. folaron has been working for years in translation studies, bridging languages, cultures and worldviews,” says patrick leroux, associate dean of research in the faculty of arts and science. “with this chair, she’ll be able to connect to a rich and thriving romani studies scene, positioning concordia as the new north american hub for such study.” europe’s romani peoples and their languages the romani peoples, long referred to as gypsies, tsiganes, gitans and other variants, are a transnational and multilingual ethnic group that has settled around the globe and has been present on the european continent for nearly 600 years. “they comprise one of the most fascinating multilingual translation contexts in the world,” folaron notes. “romani peoples have survived for over 1,000 years outside of india, through many migrations and the marginalization of their language and culture — resulting in a romani language of over 60 dialects in contact linguistically with world languages everywhere,” she adds. “because there has never been a romani nation-state, they are always educated in the national language of the country where they live, leading to them being bilingual and multilingual. their distinctive historical, social and political contexts lead to a unique set of translation practices.” the other part of folaron’s research looks at multilingual translation practices and their theorization in the digital world. “we use various translation technologies to communicate and relay information across linguistic and cultural borders around the globe. although it’s not always noticeable, translation plays a critical role globally, from the highest level of the financial services sector to humanitarian and crisis situations on the ground.” as europe’s largest minority group, the multilingual romani are of particular relevance to the language and translation policies of the eu. along with her jean monnet courses, folaron will be organizing romani workshops and a summer school with leading romani and translation studies scholars. “i’m delighted to expand on the fonds de recherche du québec – société et culture–funded research on romani and minority translation that began in 2007,” she says. “i’m thrilled and look forward to integrating these interlingual, intercultural dialogues — which are so critical to the principles and values of the eu, canada and quebec — to my jean monnet teaching and research activities at concordia.” find out more about concordia’s département d’études françaises.   related topics 	 research 	 	 jean monnet 	 	 languages

does concordia ensure social distancing and minimize risk of infection on campus and in open labs? we are working with the government of quebec, public health authorities and the city of montreal as well as public transit commissions to use an approach centered on the respect of social distancing norms and on the protection of all. as we have done throughout the covid-19 pandemic, we will adhere scrupulously to all public health directives and carefully consider the sanitization and subsequent use of shared spaces such as stairs, elevators and eating areas. how do i re-open my lab? research labs continue to be opened. professors should contact the associate dean, research of their faculty to learn more. there is no longer a need to contact faculties to add personnel to labs unless a faculty specifically chooses to maintain this requirement. what are the procedures for assessing the capacity limits of research spaces? environmental health & safety (ehs) will assess new research spaces for capacity limits upon request. for dry labs and meeting rooms, normal capacity of the space is permitted with mask rules. for wet labs, existing capacity as set by ehs can be maintained with all personnel/students being scheduled accordingly and mask rules followed. if a pi wants the capacity increased, they must ask ehs for a new assessment. ehs has prepared guidelines for shared computer labs. what kinds of sanitization protocols are in place? the university is following recommendations and guidelines of the cnesst and has enhanced cleaning and sanitization for areas that are frequented by faculty, staff and students. additional hand sanitizing stations have been added. in addition, those accessing campus are required to use hand sanitizer upon arrival. training has been implemented for all individuals accessing campus to ensure a common understanding of expected behaviours for the health and safety of our community. learn more about the university’s workplace safety guidelines.    ethics & compliance what are the new covid-related procedures to conduct in-person research with humans? in-person research with humans will no longer need approval of the central committee unless it involves chapter 9 of the tcps (research with indigenous communities). the existing form and process are retained in those cases. however, the requirement to submit approval letters from all collaborating institutions/organizations, which include details on specific covid-related requirements, is still in effect. please forward all approval letters directly to the research ethics unit, at oor.ethics@concordia.ca, and clearly identify the relevant ethics protocol number linked to the request, before initiating any in-person research activities. researchers and their participants must follow the processes for visitors accessing campus during the pandemic. i conduct field research. what do i need to know before i begin? field research activities will no longer require approval, with the exception of international field research for which the field research process will be retained with the faculty associate dean, research reviewing requests with a copy sent to the office of the vice-president, research and graduate studies. international travel for conferences and workshops does not require approval. what can i do to request approval for in-person research that isn't already approved under my current protocol? you are required to submit an amendment request to your existing protocol.​ since you may eventually wish to return to online/remote research or maintain a hybrid of remote and in-person data collection in the future, please do not remove any methodologies already approved under the protocol; rather simply request the addition of in-person recruitment and data collection. the amendment request must contain: a cover email requesting an amendment to an approved protocol a separate document in pdf outlining any modifications with a clear, detailed explanation as to why the change is being made; list where each document has been modified (spf and/or supporting documents) copies of the revised spf and supporting documents with all changes clearly highlighted; do not resend all your appendices – send only those that pertain to the amendment request any new appendices; these must be provided as separate documents saved in pdf  ​ all amendment requests should be submitted by email to oor.ethics@concordia.ca. the secretariat on responsible conduct of research has shared new interpretations from the panel on research ethics to support the community in applying the tri-council policy statement: ethical conduct for research involving humans, tcps 2 (2018) during the current covid-19 publicly declared emergency. what additional risks can be considered research-attributable during the covid-19 pandemic? there are three different categories of additional research-attributable risk that can arise in the covid-19 environment: new risks arising from changes to researcher’s plan for interacting with participants: for example, a researcher may decide to communicate with participants remotely instead of in-person to respect physical distancing and mitigate the transmission/spread of the virus through human contact. while this may address risks related to physical contact, researchers and research ethics boards (rebs) should be mindful that this change introduces new risks and ethics issues related to privacy and confidentiality of information when using digital platforms and home offices, and the need for new security and safety measures to protect participants’ information. where, for example, researchers attempt to reduce the risk of infection by mailing experimental drugs to participants rather than continuing in-person participation, this will likely require a change to the researcher’s plan for monitoring any side effects. depending on the participant pool, the change from in-person to remote participation may also introduce new ethics issues related to fairness and equity, where only those with access and ability to participate remotely (e.g. due to internet connectivity, computer/ smart phone availability and capacity) can continue to participate in the research. “…[p]ractices of researchers or rebs, whether intentional or inadvertent, can exclude some members of society from participating in research” (chapter 4, introduction). new risks that emerge, even if the research plan remains unchanged: for example, the continued participation of participants who provide weekly blood samples at a hospital may subject them to new risks of exposure to the coronavirus during their commute, or as a result of their proximity to other participants or to members of the research team. also, new public health requirements for reporting can introduce new risks related to privacy and confidentiality in ongoing research. for example, if new security standards require researchers to retain the participants’ personal information for contact tracing purposes, researchers can no longer guarantee participants’ anonymity (see application of article 5.2). in addition to risks of increased participant exposure to the virus, there are possible societal risks of further transmitting the virus beyond the individual participants to other third parties, including family members. changes in risk levels arising from changes to the participants’ personal circumstances: during the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, “participants … may be rendered more vulnerable by the nature of the emergency” (application of article 6.21). vulnerabilities can be psychological due to isolation, stress, anxiety, or for economic reasons due to financial burdens of the pandemic or unemployment. vulnerabilities can also be social in nature due to limited access to critical services, or physical vulnerability due to pre-existing medical conditions or age. for example, when research on self-harm or suicide involving participants began in non-pandemic times and continues in a covid-19 environment, researchers need to re-assess the vulnerability of their participants in the context of research. researchers should consider the additional stress that participants may be experiencing in their personal life. participants who take part in ongoing research at a research site may be anxious or fearful about exposure in a potential covid-19 environment, and may no longer wish to continue participating in research. similarly, a high-risk research study conducted in-person to test a new drug on immunocompromised patients may be deemed acceptable for those participants in non-pandemic times. however, the risk to participants may rise to unacceptable levels in a pandemic context. participants may no longer accept risks they would have otherwise accepted in non-pandemic contexts. others may be willing to accept risks they would not have otherwise accepted, in the absence of a known cure for covid-19 or covid related complications; for example, participation in treatment trials for those infected with the virus or participation in prevention trials, including participation in vaccine studies. are researchers required to amend their applications and consent forms for reb review in light of additional research-attributable risks in a pandemic environment? changes or unanticipated issues that may increase the level of risk for participants or that have other ethical implications affecting participants’ welfare must be submitted for research ethics board (reb) review (see articles 6.15 and 6.16). as with other changes to the research, the level of additional risks and their impact on the welfare of participants determine when researchers should report the changes to the reb - whether immediately, or if the researcher can document and summarize the changes in annual status reports. where applicable, researchers must also provide to the reb their plan to manage additional risks through safety plans or technical safeguards, and their efforts to reach a favorable balance of risks and benefits for participants. as with the assessment of the ethical acceptability of research, the reb review of the changes “involves consideration of the foreseeable risks, the potential benefits and the ethical implications of the research” (article 2.9). rebs assess those risks that are attributable to the research. the tcps states that “[w]hen describing the foreseeable risks and potential benefits of research involving participants who are also exposed to other risks, researchers should clearly distinguish between the risks that are attributable to the research, and the risks to which participants would normally be exposed” (article 2.10). researchers must inform participants of the changes or unanticipated additional research-attributable risks as part of their “ongoing duty to provide participants with all information relevant to their ongoing consent to participate in research” (article 3.3). in deciding when, how, and how frequently to advise participants of additional risks, researchers and rebs should be guided by the level of those risks and their impact on the potential welfare of participants. they must also consider whether any other policies or requirements apply to the changed circumstances that create the additional risks. these policies and requirements might be sufficient measures to address the identified risk, and therefore changes to the research are not required. what issues should rebs consider in assessing the researcher’s plan to conduct research in a pandemic environment? the onus is on the researcher to satisfy the research ethics board (reb) that the research can proceed during the pandemic. the following are some questions that rebs should consider in reviewing the ethical acceptability of initial submissions of research or ongoing research in a pandemic environment. each research is different, and the nature of participant pools varies, so the issues to consider should be tailored on a case-by-case basis. impact on study conduct and its scientific validity can the research involve participants remotely rather than in person? is the research question still relevant within the context of the pandemic environment? will the pandemic environment impact or alter the representativeness of the participant sample, or the sample plan, and thus its scientific validity? has interruption of the research (i.e., the stopping and resumption due to the pandemic), or the availability of research funds, impacted its scientific validity or feasibility? impact on risks and benefits of research has the researcher considered new risks attributed to the research as a result of covid-19 environment? has the level of risk of previously approved research changed? can the researcher maintain a favorable balance of risks and benefits? what measures has the researcher taken to mitigate any increased levels of risk? does resuming the research impose additional burdens on participants (e.g. telecommunications cost) to continue to participate in the research? does the researcher expect the vulnerability of the participants to change within the context of the research? are the initial anticipated benefits of research still possible? impact on the consent process do alternate consent strategies need to be considered, for example seeking consent over the internet rather than in person? is the information provided to participants as part of the consent process still accurate, or does it need to be updated? does resumption or continuation of approved research introduce unanticipated changes that may increase the level of risk to require informing the participants as part of the ongoing consent process, for example, informing participants about new information, changed procedures, or changed protections that might affect the participants’ choice to continue to participate in the research? other ethics issues if there is a change to previously approved research, does it raise other ethics issues e.g. inclusion and exclusion issues or new risks related to privacy and confidentiality? in the case of multi-jurisdictional and international research, is the researcher sufficiently aware of the local covid-19 circumstances in the other sites to be able to assess any changed level of risk to participants, and how this may affect any proposed changes to the study and its procedures? where research is based on community engagement or research agreements, has the researcher considered how to negotiate or implement any proposed changes (e.g. additional consultation, engagement or permission needed to begin recruitment or resume the research)? are there other community constraints or institutional permissions required to begin recruitment or resume the research? while not a formal part of rebs’ responsibilities, do rebs have concerns about the safety of researchers and the research team members (e.g. the availability of personal protective equipment) that rebs should share with researchers or refer to other appropriate bodies within the institution? funding updates where can i find updates from the canadian federal funding agencies? for the most up-to-date information, please refer to each agency’s website. natural sciences and engineering research council of canada (nserc) social sciences and humanities research council (sshrc)  canadian institutes of health research (cihr) canada foundation for innovation (cfi) where can i find updates from the

presented to 13 community members december 8, 2021 | by fiona downey the exceptional work of concordians who actively engaged with news media over the past year was celebrated at a digital event on december 1. concordia president graham carr kicked off the president’s media outreach awards announcements by emphasizing the value of communicating with the wider public about the university’s research and teaching activities. “concordia’s experts work really hard, not only to provide solutions to some of the great challenges that face society but to communicate those challenges in a public way and that’s important for universities,” he said. carr thanked the faculty members, students and staff for taking the time to speak with journalists and provide fact-based perspective, pointing out that their media appearances had been crucial over the past year and a half-plus. “as we’ve seen over the course of the last 20 months, the importance of sharing our expertise with the public has taken on a heightened significance in the context of the pandemic,” added carr. quebec’s chief scientist remi quirion spoke at the awards ceremony. he reinforced carr’s views on the significance of communicating scholarly work, especially at this particular juncture, saying he had delighted in seeing the spotlight thrown on researchers alongside politicians and public health officials. “i hope that, post-pandemic, scientists will continue to be very present in the media, traditional media, social media, explaining science. we have a role there as experts to help others follow in your footsteps,” he said. quirion pointed out that the fonds de recherche du québec has rolled out a number of programs that seek to support scholars in effectively communicating their scientific knowledge through the media. both quirion and carr believe such efforts will have huge impacts on challenges such as climate change, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. concordia’s four academic deans were joined by anne whitelaw, provost and vice-president, academic, paula wood-adams, interim vice-president of research and graduate studies, and philippe beauregard, chief communications officer, in honouring this year’s president’s media outreach awards recipients . the 2021 award winners are: research communicators of the year – international – leon wang and bettina forget research communicator of the year – national – simon bacon graduate research communicator of the year – marc-andré argentino opinion leaders of the year – jean-philippe warren and philippe rioux expert commentator of the year – ann-louise davidson francophone media communicator of the year – ted rutland communications ambassadors of the year – annick maugile flavien, angélique willkie and manon tremblay a special award was presented posthumously to nadia chaudhri, professor in the department of psychology, for her exceptional grace, strength and determination as she raised awareness about ovarian cancer, the disease she battled until her death last october. chaudhri also spearheaded the launch of the nadia chaudhri wingspan award and a record-setting fundraising effort that will provide scholarships to students from underrepresented backgrounds pursuing their training in the field of neuroscience. a new award category was introduced this year to recognize outstanding contributions to the conversation and its quebec-based edition, la conversation. louise champoux-paillé, executive-in-residence at the john molson school of business, was honoured with the inaugural award for the many pieces she wrote for the online platform, with a focus on the impact of women in leadership roles throughout the pandemic. watch a recording of the virtual ceremony of concordia’s 2020-21 president’s

competition winner for quebec maggy hamel-metsos takes home $7,500 and her work was shown at the university of toronto virtual art museum december 9, 2021 | by 		andy murdoch maggy hamel-metsos: “it feels really good to see that the art i make resonates with others.” | photos by william bobby sabourin maggy hamel-metsos (bfa 2021), a recent graduate of concordia’s department of studio arts, is quebec’s regional winner of the 19th annual bmo 1st art! competition. the jury chose 13 artists from a record 336 submissions to the competition. anna kuelken from nscad university won the national cash prize of $15,000. hamel-metsos and the other 11 regional winners each took home $7,500. “part of it is luck and part of it is hard work. but i don’t wait on luck — i work very hard and i don’t expect anything in return,” hamel-metsos says. “when validation like this comes around, it feels really good to see that the art i make resonates with others.” her original work, entitled “no place to stand,” explores how important private and public spaces revealed themselves to be throughout the covid-19 pandemic. “during covid, it became a burden to stay inside. the interiors of houses — and other spaces — appeared more and more like barricades. i often have a push and pull situation towards the themes showing up in my work, which might just be the aesthetic motivation i need,” hamel-metsos explains. “i always go toward things i hate and love at the same time. i hate drapery — i think it’s sort of kitsch, but i saw its potential. drapery became more about an apparatus, a system of hiding and revealing, addressing notions of accessibility, mobility and transparency.” aside from the drapes, there are no recognizable symbols or iconography, she adds. “so there is space for people to project onto the work. it’s not about me; it’s about an apparatus.” ‘this year’s winners had to overcome unprecedented circumstances’ hamel-metsos graduated from the studio art program this summer. she recently acquired a larger studio and is trying to strike a balance in that precarious postgraduation situation of working to support oneself and living as an artist. the bmo 1st art! award celebrates outstanding achievements in visual arts among undergraduate students from across canada. every year, deans and instructors from 110 undergraduate art programs nominate three students from each of their studio specialties to submit a recent work. competition guidelines allow for video, film, audio and computer technologies, in addition to mediums of drawing, printmaking, photography, painting, sculpture, glass, ceramics, textiles, mixed media and installation works. jurors this year were anne-marie st-jean aubre, curator of contemporary art for the musée d’art de joliette; melanie colosimo, director/curator of anna leonowens gallery at nscad university; and francisco-fernando granados, artist and educator. “this year’s winners had to overcome unprecedented circumstances to excel at their craft,” says dawn cain, curator of the bmo art collection. “we are grateful for the opportunity to share their exceptional works with fellow art lovers from coast to coast to coast in a virtual exhibition.” all 13 winning works were displayed in an exhibition hosted by the university of toronto on their virtual art museum site from november 16 to december 8. find out more about concordia’s department of studio arts. images of the bmo 1st art!

""they’re building a maker space and they needed guidance and help on how to create different types of projects,"" she notes. lamarche adds that the innovation lab actually promotes mistakes. ""ann-louise says, 'it’s okay. learn from that. adapt yourself. move forward, iterate and continue.' you grow from your mistakes."" another benefit? a true team interdisciplinary approach. ""teamwork doesn't always make the dream work, but collaboration does,"" lamarche says. ""when we started to collaborate in the innovation lab, everybody was an equal and there was no competition between us."" with the assistance of coordinator ariel harlap, the innovation lab team is looking forward to the winter term. ""we are only just getting started,"" davidson says. ""this is an incredibly exciting place and time to be in education."" learn more about concordia’s innovation lab.   related topics 	 teaching 	 	 arts 	 	 learning 	 	 students 	 	 education 	 you might also like: concordia’s innovation lab allows students to pitch and test out new ideas concordia’s ann-louise davidson debuts a children’s book about maker culture trending concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the montreal climate partnership november 10, 2021 improvements to concordia’s henry f. hall building enter the next stage november 16, 2021 the president’s task force on anti-black racism releases its preliminary recommendations november 15, 2021 back to top © concordia university concordia university - call us at 514-848-2424 about academics admissions campus life research international careers future students current students alumni & friends parents faculty & staff media sir george williams campus 1455 de maisonneuve blvd. w. montreal, quebec, canada h3g 1m8 see sgw campus map loyola campus 7141 sherbrooke street w. montreal, quebec, canada h4b 1r6 see loyola campus map instagram linkedin facebook twitter youtube flickr concordia social © concordia university terms privacy accessibility contact us website feedback concordia.ca call us at 514-848-2424 sir george williams campus 1455 de maisonneuve blvd. w. montreal, quebec, canada h3g 1m8 see sgw campus map loyola campus 7141 sherbrooke street w. montreal, quebec, canada h4b 1r6 see loyola campus map share this page share on facebook share on twitter share on linkedin contact us website feedback terms privacy accessibility © concordia university concordia university uses technical, analytical, marketing and preference cookies. these are necessary for our site to function properly and to create the best possible online experience. accept   privacy policy"

désirée rochat: before being a researcher, i have been a community worker and educator for over two decades. i started as a teenager after i arrived in montreal, and i have never stopped. through my community work i got to discover the tremendously rich histories of social and political mobilizations of other immigrant and racialized communities, especially of other caribbean and black communities. as i learnt these histories, i became aware of their political, intellectual and pedagogical significance. my desire to transmit and engage with these histories started there. the research i do now that connects the preservation and transmission of histories of black communities’ activism is a direct continuation of my community organizing and educational practice. what inspired your research and interests? dr: my work aims to bring forth the histories and knowledges of racialized and immigrant communities through an integrative approach connecting history, archival sciences and education. the common thread of my interests in community education, community archives, archival engagement and pedagogy, and histories of black communities’ activism is knowledge. ultimately, i am interested in how people produce, transmit, acquire and preserve knowledge. what are a few misconceptions about your research? dr: i research, theorize and work to preserve histories of black diasporic activism. but ultimately, these are histories of activism, political organizing and community building — period. they are relevant for how we understand transnational practices and politics in general, how we understand community organizing more broadly and how we understand the world in its complexity. so, i work to preserve black communities’ histories because they are histories that we can all learn from. they are necessary to have a broader understanding of world politics and history. are there some best and innovative practices that you would recommend within the context of the library’s special collections? dr: the library’s special collections has made the acquisition of archives related to english-speaking black community organizations in montreal and black history in quebec part of its collecting priorities. these initiatives have put the library in a position to become a unique resource on black community heritage within quebec and potentially within canada. but to foster an ethical and anti-racist approach to the acquisition, documentation and use of these archives, and to encourage engagement from black community members inside and outside the university, the development of these acquisitions needs to be embedded in a wider social justice and community-based framework. what i aim to do is to propose mechanisms and strategies building from my community practice to ensure a holistic and representative approach to collection development, accessibility and use so that the diverse contributions of black communities are integrated and activated comprehensibly. what attracted you to concordia library’s researcher-in-residence program? dr: i am an alumna of the university and an affiliate of the centre for oral history and digital storytelling (cohds). in 2017 i collaborated with steven high, professor in the department of history and alexandra mills, the library’s special collections archivist, for the course hist 388: telling stories, which was based on the ncc/charles h. este cultural centre fonds. i also have worked with annick maugile flavien and teeanna munro from the black perspectives office in the past, through our community work. being able to collaborate in this context is interesting because here we are, three community workers bringing our practice to participate in the transformation of the university. i’m looking forward to developing projects with all these collaborators. find out more about concordia library’s researcher-in-residence program and connect with désirée rochat at desiree.rochat@concordia.ca.   related topics 	 research 	 	 libraries 	 you might also like: concordia library’s former researcher-in-residence advances machine translation literacy project new researcher-in-residence is rethinking the concordia library as a sensory experience trending concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the montreal climate partnership november 10, 2021 improvements to concordia’s henry f. hall building enter the next stage november 16, 2021 the president’s task force on anti-black racism releases its preliminary recommendations november 15, 2021 back to top © concordia university concordia university - call us at 514-848-2424 about academics admissions campus life research international careers future students current students alumni & friends parents faculty & staff media sir george williams campus 1455 de maisonneuve blvd. w. montreal, quebec, canada h3g 1m8 see sgw campus map loyola campus 7141 sherbrooke street w. montreal, quebec, canada h4b 1r6 see loyola campus map instagram linkedin facebook twitter youtube flickr concordia social © concordia university terms privacy accessibility contact us website feedback concordia.ca call us at 514-848-2424 sir george williams campus 1455 de maisonneuve blvd. w. montreal, quebec, canada h3g 1m8 see sgw campus map loyola campus 7141 sherbrooke street w. montreal, quebec, canada h4b 1r6 see loyola campus map share this page share on facebook share on twitter share on linkedin contact us website feedback terms privacy accessibility © concordia university concordia university uses technical, analytical, marketing and preference cookies. these are necessary for our site to function properly and to create the best possible online experience. accept   privacy policy"

graduate        how to register: note: the screenshots included in this registration guide could contain prior term examples of step by step registration processes. do not confuse the dates you see in the examples in this guide with the actual current term dates and information. step 1 — academic advising academic advising the requirements for advising prior to registration vary according to your program of study. to determine if you require advising refer to the holds box on your student center page or go to your faculty or school’s advising information page by clicking on the appropriate link below. how to contact your academic advisor: in most cases, you will be assigned an academic advisor for your main plan of study and potentially for any additional plans that you may have. you can easily see the advisor information from the homepage of your student centre: this displays the name of your individual advisor or advising team along with their contact telephone number (if available). if you click on the “details” link, you will see a breakdown of which advisor or advising team relates to each of your plans. if available, and depending on the email program you are using, you can click on the link where the name of the advisor or advising team is shown. this will allow you to email your advisor. if there is no link, then no email address has been provided and you should use the contact phone number to reach your advisor. note: if you are using an internet email client such as gmail, you can hover the cursor over the link and the email address will be displayed in the bottom left of your screen. alternatively, depending on the browser you are using, you can right-click on the link and select ‘copy email address’. you may then paste the address into your email client. you can also get more information about advising from the links below:    »  arts and science    »  john molson school of business    »  engineering and computer science    »  fine arts    »  independent students step 2 — accessing registration register for courses. you can also find the link to register on to the student hub's my cu account page. if you are on a mobile device or a tablet, click the enroll tile to begin your registration process. if you are using a desktop, you can access the enrolment functions from the left-hand navigation enrollment dropdown or by clicking on enroll on the right. step 3 — plan your timetable to assist you in planning your timetable we have included information on how to look for courses three different ways: a – use the concordia class schedule builder the concordia class schedule builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule. b – use the class search you can search for a range of classes based on specific criteria you can define. c – browse the course catalog this is a comprehensive listing of courses offered at concordia university. please note the following: test results if you plan on registering for english composition or esl (english as a second language) courses and have written the appropriate placement test, your results will be sent to you by e-mail. requisites pre-requisites – these are usually either specific classes you must have taken or a minimum amount of credits that you will need to have obtained before you can register for a given class. co-requisites – these are classes that need to be taken at the same time (or previously) in order to be able to register for a given class. anti-requisites – these are other classes for which you must not have previously received credit (including any transfer credit or exemptions) in order to be eligible to register for a given class. for example, mark495 is an anti-requisite of mark301. to register for mark301, students should not have previously taken and received credit for mark495. the reason for these types of requirements are to stop students taking courses out of sequence or taking a higher level course and then trying to take a lower level course that may have similar content. you should consult the undergraduate calendar to see the requisites for the course in which you want to register. if you receive a message about ‘requisites not met’ when trying to register for a class, you should ensure that you have met all of the requisites as stated in the undergraduate calendar. if you believe that you have then you will need to speak to your department (jmsb students, please contact the undergraduate student affairs office) so that they can look into this matter for you. degree students: you are not permitted to register for a course that has a prerequisite if you have not completed that prerequisite. if you have received authorization from an academic advisor to register for a course without the stated prerequisite, the advisor must enter a waiver that will permit you access to the course. independent/visiting students: if you wish to register for courses where the prerequisite was completed elsewhere, you must complete a “prerequisite waiver form” and receive approval prior to registering. note that you must include specific details of the course, including the course name and number, where and when it was completed, as well as the course description and transcripts. this form is available at the birks student service centre.   reserve seats in classes some classes have seats that are reserved for students in specific programs. this is usually done to ensure that students who need the class as part of their program are able to register for it. depending on the rules defined by the department that offers the class, they may set all, some, or none of the seats to be reserved.  if you try to register for a class and receive a message about ‘reserved seats’ then you should select another class or consult the department or the undergraduate student affairs office, for jmsb students to obtain permission to take the class. department consent some classes may require that you first obtain permission to take the class. if you receive a message that states: “department consent required”, you will need to speak to the department that offers the class in order to obtain permission to register. jmsb students will need to contact the undergraduate student affairs office.          a — use the concordia class schedule builder the concordia class schedule builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule. note that the tool does not register you for any courses but will allow you to add courses directly to your enrollment course cart. you will then need to follow the instructions further down this page in step 6a – adding classes. you can access the concordia class schedule builder from four different places in your student centre: 1. student centre homepage log into the student information system and navigate to the student centre. click the “class schedule builder” link shown in the image below. 2. class search page log into the student information system and navigate to the student centre. click the “search for classes” button on the top right of the page. on the search for classes page, click the “search with class schedule builder” button. 3. enrollment course cart page log into the student information system and navigate to the student centre. then either click the ‘enroll’ or ‘enrollment course cart’ links. then on the next page select the relevant term and click continue. once in the enrollment course cart, select the ‘class schedule builder’ option (shown below) and click ‘search’. 4. class schedule page log into the student information system and navigate to the student centre.  select the ‘class schedule’ option from the drop-down list in the academics section.  then on the next page select the relevant term and click continue. on the ‘my class schedule’ page, select the ‘view in class schedule builder’ option at the top right. for more information about how to use the concordia class schedule builder, please watch the instructional video available on the student hub.          b — use the class search the search for classes function is used to look for information about scheduled classes for a particular term and is generally available in early march. a variety of search criteria may be entered to narrow or broaden a search. search results provide information such as date and time of classes, location, name of instructor, number of seats available and so on. to search for classes: select the desired term from the drop-down menu. term selection example: for a summer class, select “summer 2021” for a fall class, select “fall 2021” for a winter class, select “winter 2022” for a fall / winter class, select “fall/winter 2021-22” (6 credit full year classes only) to view classes in all terms of the academic year, select “all terms (2021-2022) note: any terms in the list that end in “(cce only)” will only return results for continuing education classes. enter search criteria into open fields: conduct a basic search by entering information into the fields displayed under class search criteria (see basic search criteria table below for more information), or conduct an advanced search by clicking the additional search criteria fields (see advanced search criteria table below for more information). note: you must enter or select a minimum of two search criteria (in addition to the term selection).   use the clear button to clear information from the fields and enter new search criteria. click the search button to retrieve results. view information returned on the search results page: if you are searching in a term in which you have already enrolled, your “my class schedule” will be displayed. a summary of the search criteria entered list of classes that meet the search

search or modify search button if a class in the search results is offered in a career and term that you are active in, then you will be able to use the “select” button next to the class to add it to your course cart. for example, if you are in an undergraduate program but search for a graduate class, the select button will not appear. if you are already enrolled in a class or a class is already in your enrollment course cart, the “select” button will not appear.   basic search criteria term the “term” drop down refers to the term for which you are searching for class(es). course career the “course career” drop-down menu allows you to select if you want to search for classes offered to undergraduates, graduates, professional development (gradproskills), research, or classes in continuing education. select subject the green “select subject” button provides an alphabetical listing of all class subjects that have been offered historically (these may not currently be offered). if you already know the abbreviation of the class subject, type it into the blank field beside the “select subject” button. for example, type “engl” for english classes, or “fina” for finance classes. course number the “course number” field narrows the search down further to a specific class. for example, if you want to search for the poli 202 class, you would enter “poli” in the ‘select subject’ field above and then enter “202” into the ‘course number’ field. course level the “course level” field allows you to search for classes at a specific level. you can select multiple levels if you wish to view a larger range of results. for example, if you want to view all 200-level classes, select the “200” checkbox. if you want to view all 500 and 600-level classes, select both the “500” and “600” checkboxes. note: the course level option can only be used for credit courses. this can be combined with the ‘select subject’ field or the ‘department or faculty’ field to refine results. department or faculty the “department or faculty” field allows you to search for classes offered by a specific department or faculty. for example, to search for classes offered by the education department, select “education” from the drop-down menu. to search for classes offered by the fine arts faculty, select “faculty of fine arts” from the drop-down menu. note: when searching for classes offered by a faculty, you may have to refine your search by selecting additional criteria. . additional search criteria class times the “class times” field refers to the class start and end times. entering a time in the first field will search for all classes starting after the time entered. entering a time in the second field will search for all classes ending before the time entered. these fields can be used together to search for classes within a desired range. note: the times should be entered in a 24-hour format. for example, if you wish to search for 7am, enter “07.00”, or for 7pm, enter “19.00”. days of the week you can select any of the checkboxes next to the relevant day(s) of the week to include classes offered on that day in the search. note: if you select a specific day, the search results will include classes that are scheduled on that day, including any classes that are split between the selected day and another day. for example, if you select the “mon” checkbox only, you will see classes scheduled on a monday only and classes scheduled on a monday and wednesday. location you can use the “location” field to search for any combination of ‘in-person’ classes scheduled at the ‘sir george williams (downtown)’ or ‘loyola’ campuses, or for ‘online courses. note: if you search only for online classes, then any class times entered or days of week selected will be ignored. instructor last name search for classes taught by a specific instructor by entering the first few letters, the exact last name, or letters contained in the name. course keyword search for a class by its title and description. enter a full or partial keyword to return search results that include all classes with the keyword or partial keyword as part of the title or description. class nbr enter the ‘class nbr’ if known. this is a 4 or 5-digit class number that a class is assigned in the student information system. note: this is not the same number as the “course number” field above. mode of instruction

blended learning – blended learning courses are a combination of in-class and online learning. class times, locations and specific dates listed in days/times and start/end date fields will indicate

a comprehensive listing of information about courses offered at concordia university.    navigation:  academics > search > browse course catalog to browse for courses: course list provides the opportunity to look for a particular course subject by selecting the first letter of the subject of the course: selecting a letter brings up a list of matching course subjects. selecting a particular course subject will display a list of courses available. important note:  the existence of a course on this list does not guarantee that the course is currently offered. if you click on the “course nbr” or “course title” column you will be able to see the course details: the course detail page will identify whether or not the course has been scheduled. if it is scheduled, you will be able to “view class sections” to learn how many sections are available and when they are offered. if a course does not have a description, please refer to the undergraduate academic calendar for further details regarding the course. selecting the view class sections link displays the term in which you are considering taking the course and you can see whether or not it is being offered. step 4 — enrollment appointment dates the enrollment appointment date is the first date on which you may begin the registration process for that term. your individual date will be displayed in the enrollment dates box on your student center page. example: although the enrollment appointment dates indicate when you will be able to start registering, you can start planning and filling your course cart in early march.  the enrollment appointment date is based on the number of credits to completion for your program if you are a degree student. if you wish to calculate your enrollment appointment date, the following formula is used: program length (minimum credits required) minus credits earned minus in progress courses as of february 2019 (excluding disc courses) equals credits to completion. following are all the enrollment appointment dates for 2021-22: enrollment appointment dates summer 2021 (term number 2211) fall 2021 (term number 2212) fall/winter 2021 - 22 (term number 2213) winter 2022 (term number 2214)   enrollment appointment date credits to completion or category of student march 9 0 to 9 credits + coop students, varsity students march 10 10 to 21 credits march 11 22 to 33

authorized undergraduate independent students for winter 2022 (term number 2214) step 5 — system availability on the enrollment appointment dates, the system is programmed to be available from 8 a.m. onward. the registration system may be extremely busy at 8 a.m. on each new enrollment appointment date. step 6 — registration while departmental and faculty advisors and staff are always available to give advice and guidance, you are responsible for the completeness and correctness of your course selection and registration, and for observing the university’s regulations and deadlines.    navigation:  academics > my academics if the information concerning your program is incorrect you may contact 514-848-2424, ext. 2668 to find out how to make corrections. it is important for this information to be correct, as the wrong degree or concentration may block you from entering courses for which you are eligible. address verification – on the student center page, you will see your current address. if you need to correct your address or any other piece of personal information, click on the relevant area under the personal information banner and you will be redirected to another screen where you can make the necessary changes. please note that you are responsible for providing the university with your current mailing and e-mail address. you are required to fulfill all financial and administrative obligations within the prescribed deadlines regardless of the validity of your address in our files. student hub > get to know your self-service portal          a — adding classes you can add classes to your schedule for the selected term in three easy steps with a couple of restrictions to note: if you have a financial hold you will not be able to register in classes until you clear the hold. classes can only be added until the add/drop deadline for a given term. for additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the term dates and deadlines link in the important information section of the student center page.    navigation:  academics > enroll > add once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection. click the continue button.   find a class to add, using one of the options displayed, or, if you know the class number, enter it into the enter class nbr field class schedule builder – refer to step 3 a – use the concordia class schedule builder above if you need further help. class search – refer to step 3 b – use the class search above if you need further help. to view details of the course, click on the section to obtain further information about the course. if satisfied that you wish to enroll in this course, choose “select”. confirm the class information. if the section selected also requires you to register for additional components such as labs, tutorials, conferences, etc. you will be required to make that choice before proceeding further: once you have selected the conference, press next.  you will receive confirmation that the course has been added to your course cart. note: having a course added to your course cart does not mean that you are registered in the course. you must click on ‘proceed to step 2 of 3’ or  ‘enroll’ in order to go to the final confirmation page. at this point, you may continue to add further courses to your course cart. once you have added all your required courses, you will need to click on the “proceed to step 2 of 3” button. if your registration was successful you will see the following message: if it was unsuccessful you will receive an error explaining what the problem is and what you must do to rectify the situation. here is just one possible example: for example, the above message is informing you that departmental consent is required before you can register in this course. it would be necessary for you to contact the relevant department to obtain the necessary consent. in other instances, you may be denied registration in a course that appears to have seats available. this is caused by the department/faculty having reserved seats for students in a particular department or program of study. remember to register for all terms summer (2191), fall (2192), fall/winter (2193) and winter (2194) at the same time – do not wait until later in the fall to register for your winter courses as you may find them filled to capacity.          b — dropping classes please note: if you only want to change sections of the same course see step 6, c – swapping classes. there are three easy steps to dropping a class from your schedule but there are two different types of course withdrawals and both are controlled by deadline dates shown in the term dates and deadlines. please note the following important details: dne – did not enter – the dne date is generally one to two weeks after the first day of classes. a withdrawal (drop) before the dne deadline date is treated as if you were never in the course. there will be no entry on your student record for that course and you will not be charged tuition and other fees for that course. if you have already paid for the course, you will receive financial credit for course fees. disc – discontinue – the disc date is later in the term. a withdrawal (drop) after the dne date, but before the disc deadline date allows you to stop attending that course with no academic penalty. unlike the dne, however, the course will remain on your student record with an entry of disc and you will be held financially responsible for the payment of 100% of tuition and other fees, including the winter portion of a full-year course. not attending classes, or informing an instructor of an intent to withdraw, does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does it entitle a student to a refund of fees or cancellation of registration. without formally dropping the course by the appropriate academic withdrawal deadline, non-attendance of a class will result in the assignment of a failing grade. if you enroll in a fall term course that is a prerequisite for a winter course and later drop the fall course, the faculty/department involved will run a process at the beginning of the winter term to ensure that all students registered in a course with prerequisites have successfully completed that prerequisite. once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed, you will not have the option to select that term. if you have a financial hold, you will be able to drop classes, but you will not be able to add classes. if you intend to replace a dropped class with a new class, ensure that all financial holds are cleared. for additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the term dates and deadlines link in the important information section of the student center page.    navigation:  academics > enroll > drop note: if you receive an error message stating “you are not authorized for self service enrollment at this time” when you click on the drop tab, you will need to click the “change term” button and then follow the steps below. select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table. once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection from the table. click the continue button. all registered classes for the term will be displayed in a grid. multi-component classes will display all registered sections. select the class(es) you want to drop and click the drop selected classes button. note that you are able to drop multiple courses at once if you wish to do so. select the my class schedule button to retrieve your class schedule and confirm that the class(es) are no longer shown or if they are, that they correctly show the status as dropped or dsc.          c — swapping classes (including section changes) you can swap one course for another or one section for a different one. the process is a combination of add and drop. the swap function allows you to verify the availability of another course or section of the same course before you make a decision. there is, therefore, no risk of losing the section you have if another section is not available.  do not, under any circumstances, use the drop and add features to accomplish a section change. if you drop the section that you are currently registered for and then find out that no spaces are available in other sections, you may not be able to get back into the section you were originally registered in as another student may have taken your place once you dropped the course. there are some restrictions attached to swapping classes: if you have a financial hold you will not be able to swap any classes until you clear the hold. classes can only be swapped until the add/drop deadline for a given term.  for additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the term dates and deadlines link in the important information section of the student center page. if you are not enrolled in any classes you will not have access to swap classes. the swap feature should not be used to swap between summer classes in different summer sessions. for example, do not use it to swap from a may to june course into a june to august course or from a full summer (may to august) course into either a may to june course or a june to august course. to swap a component of a multi-component class while keeping one or more of the other components (for example, swap hist 202 lec a, conf aa for hist 202 lec a, conf bb while keeping the same lecture) see the section entitled swapping multi-component classes.    navigation:  academics > enroll > swap select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table. click the continue button. the first grid on this page called, swap this class, displays a list of classes in which you are currently enrolled. the next section, called with this class, allows you to search for a class using the class search feature, or to select from your course cart, or to enter the class nbr if you already know it. select the class that you wish to swap from with the swap this class grid. select the class that you want to swap to using the with this class grid. if you use the search feature and identify a course, you will be asked to choose the section you want by using the “select class” button and you are then re-directed to the confirm your selection page. if you select from your course cart, using the select button next to that option takes you to the confirm your selection page. if you use the enter class nrb feature and press enter you will eventually reach the confirm your selection page. confirm your selection and click the finish swapping button. if the swap is unsuccessful either follow the instructions in the error message or try another course by selecting swap from the menu bar: view my class schedule to verify the status of your swap transaction: swapping multi-component classes (while keeping one or more of the other components) search for the class using the search function in the with this class grid. you will be prompted to make a selection for all required components even if you want to keep the same sections in which you are already enrolled. confirm your selection. all related components of a class will be displayed. verify the swap transaction. view my class schedule to ensure that the class has been swapped in your registration. please note – if you try to swap one of your components for another one that is currently on a waitlist, then you will be placed on the waitlist for all components of the class and potentially lose your place in the class. if you do not want to take this risk, then do not use the swap feature to swap components if your preferred component is on a waitlist. for example: you are currently enrolled in comp248 lecture u, tutorial u ua and laboratory ui-x. you want to stay in lecture u and laboratory ui-x, but swap the tutorial for u ub (which is on a waitlist). if you attempt to do this using a swap, you will lose your existing places in lecture u, tutorial u ua and laboratory ui-x and be placed on the waitlist for lecture u, tutorial u ub and laboratory ui-x.          d — wait listing classes once all seats in a course have been filled it may still be possible for you to add your name to a wait list. academic departments have the choice of offering wait list seats or not. to determine which courses will allow you to add your name to a wait list:    navigation:  academics > search select the term select the subject select the course number search once the results of the search are displayed, click on the section hyperlink: you are now on the class detail page which indicates whether or not a wait list is available for the course selected and it is also indicated what the wait list capacity is for the course and the wait list total. this tells you that 80 students can add their name to a wait list after the class capacity of 770 has been reached. there are two scenarios under which you may add your name to a wait list. you have not yet enrolled in your maximum course load so that if a seat becomes available you would be eligible to add it to your other courses for that term. you have enrolled in your maximum course load but you set-up your name on a wait list using the swap feature so that if a seat does become available, you would swap one course for another. scenario 1 you start the registration process by trying to register for econ 201 but the course is full and you get the following error message: you use the class search described above to see the detail of the course and determine that a wait list is available and that there is still room for you to add your name. knowing this, you select the course again and tick the box labelled wait list if class is full and select next. you will see the resulting message: if a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be registered automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. the registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (dne) without financial penalty. scenario 2 if you are permitted to enroll in 15 credits in the fall term and you have already reached that capacity but still want the possibility of entering inte 123, you would use the swap this class grid to identify which of your courses you would swap. you would then go to the with this class grid and enter the course. you will then follow the normal steps to get to the point where you identify that you want to “wait list if class is full”. if a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be swapped from one course to the other automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. the registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (dne) without financial penalty. some tips about wait lists you can wait list for a maximum of 6 units per term. you cannot be wait listed for two sections of the same course. you can remove your name from a wait list by using the drop feature. note: adding your name to a waitlist does not guarantee that you will get into the class. important note: if you are on a waitlist for a course, it does not mean that you are actually registered for the course. you will only be registered into the course if a seat becomes available and the system registers you into the class based on your waitlist position. step 7 — verify your courses you can verify your schedule in two different formats. from your student center page you can choose weekly schedule. the resulting “my class schedule” page allows you to select the term for which you wish to verify your registrations. after selecting the term, press continue. you then have the choice of seeing your schedule in a list view or a weekly calendar view. the list view is as follows: the weekly calendar view is as follows: please note: the weekly calendar view of your class schedule will not show any classes that occur on a national or university holiday. any online classes that you are enrolled in will appear at the bottom of the calendar.   the concordia class schedule builder view is as below: once you have selected the term in the concordia class schedule builder, you will see the classes that you are enrolled in, are on the waitlist for, or have in your enrollment course cart. step 8 — how to obtain help if you encounter faculty-related difficulties (prerequisites, co-requisites, anti-requisites; permission of the department required; closed class, etc.) while using the registration system, you must contact your department. please refer to the following links:    »  arts and science    »  john molson school of business    »  engineering and computer science    »  fine arts for non faculty-related problems, please call 514-848-2424, ext. 2668 monday to friday, from 09:00 – 17:00, all year round, except for holidays. should you experience technical difficulties, please contact the concordia

registering for classes. you should contact your advisor or department or, for jmsb students, the undergraduate student affairs office initially and they will then contact the service desk on your behalf if it is an issue they are unable to resolve. step 9 — obtain your account balance and verify payment deadlines information regarding your account balance is available from the student center page under the finances banner: payment deadlines: due now – this is the amount that you owe for the tuition and fees for the current term. an amount may show as ‘due now’ before the final payment deadline. for example, the tuition fees for a fall term are generally due at the beginning of september but you are allowed until the end of september to pay them without financial penalty. these fees will show as ‘due now’ in your student centre from the beginning of september. future due – this is the amount that you will have to pay for the upcoming term(s), including tuition and fees for classes you have enrolled in for any upcoming term(s). for example, if you are enrolling in winter classes before the beginning of january, the tuition fees for these classes will show as ‘future due’ in your student centre until the beginning of january.   please note – if you have recently enrolled or dropped some classes and you would like to see your updated tuition balance, you can click on the “account inquiry” link in the top-left of the finances section.  this will trigger a recalculation of your tuition fees and update your balance accordingly. for more information about tuition fees
