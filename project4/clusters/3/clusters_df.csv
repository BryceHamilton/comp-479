Site search Concordia Directories Search Coronavirus (COVID-19) Concordia.ca 	 	  /  	 Coronavirus (COVID-19) 	 	  /  	 Updates 	 Concordia offers instructors tips for accessibility and inclusiveness in online courses Psychology professor Aaron Johnson outlines the principles of Universal Design for Learning August 25, 2020 | By J. Cohen With classes to resume online in the fall, faculty and administration at Concordia are collaborating to ensure effective and inclusive online learning. “With COVID-19, questions about access to technology have become more pronounced,” says Anna Barrafato (MA 98), disability accommodation specialist at Concordia’s Access Centre for Students with Disabilities (ACSD) and a sessional instructor at Concordia. “However, accessibility and inclusiveness have been an important part of the university’s focus for years.” A diverse student body “The simple reality is that students are humans. No one is perfectly suited to one specific pedagogical model,” Barrafato adds. “A growing proportion of students often find their classes and pedagogies unnecessarily rigid. While the ACSD plays an important role in providing accommodations, professors who take small measures to improve accessibility vastly improve the academic experience for their entire class. This is especially true as classes move online.” Aaron Johnson, associate professor in Concordia’s Department of Psychology, echoes this sentiment. “Accessibility doesn’t only relate to disabilities. Concordia students are culturally and linguistically diverse. They come from different countries. They’re of all ages,” he says. “Fairly simple, measures can be taken to make our classes more accessible to our diverse body of students.” Johnson also notes that it’s not quite fair to simply give students registered with the ACSD extra time to write the same test that everyone else writes. “It means that these students are simply writing longer, more exhausting tests. If the tests arbitrarily favour certain modes of expression over others, then we’re still doing a disservice to our students.” Universal Design for Learning at Concordia In collaboration with the ACSD, several years ago Johnson took part in a pilot program that introduced Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles into his courses. He has since become a champion of the pedagogical approach. “Ideally, we should offer alternative kinds of lessons, assignments and exams. Cultural, experiential, neurological and situational differences can affect how a student will respond to content or class material. With a little bit of effort, we can allow students to acquire and express knowledge in multiple ways.” The underlying premise of UDL is that a wide range of pedagogical approaches are often compatible with the specific goals of a course. The same content can be represented, transmitted and taken up by students in many different ways. These myriad approaches can be used in parallel to make the course content accessible to a diverse body of students. Instructors can define assignments and learning activities in broad terms such that each student can find a way to connect to the same material or content. And students can also be invited to demonstrate their acquired knowledge through different modes of expression or action. For example, the development of writing is often not specifically defined as part of a course outcome while exclusively remaining the accepted mode of expression. In that case, students might be given the option of writing an essay or doing an oral presentation, live or recorded. Or students could be allowed to express their newly acquired knowledge through another visual medium. “If we remember that students are supposed to be acquiring knowledge and not the ability to pass very specific kinds of academic tests, then we realize how much flexibility we’re actually able to offer them,” Johnson adds. UDL at Concordia and how to get started Barrafato points out that many professors are already implementing the kinds of course design that she’d like all students to benefit from. “We’ve been inspired to hear about the exciting and innovative ways that instructors moved their classes online mid-term last spring.” There are a few simple steps faculty can take to get started. They can offer both synchronous and asynchronous components in a course for students who are able to be engaged in different ways. Professors can upload videos of lectures through Moodle and have subtitles automatically produced for the benefit of hearing-impaired students or those for whom English is not a first language. Instructors can also upload PowerPoint lectures accompanied by an audio recording that explains the material in more depth. Faculty can consult how-to and accessibility framework tutorials to transform class materials into accessible formats and create an inclusive environment. Additional tips and tools for moving courses online can be found on the Centre for Teaching and Learning website.

Location targeting helps you focus your advertising to help find the right customers for your business. This specific type of targeting could help increase your return on investment (ROI) as a result. Note: Hotel Ads campaigns can't be targeted by radius at this time. This article explains how location targeting works and how to set it up in your account. Keep in mind Location targeting is based on a variety of signals, including users' settings, devices, and behavior on our platform, and is Google’s best effort to serve ads to users who meet your location settings. Because these signals vary, 100% accuracy is not guaranteed in every situation. As always, you should check your overall performance metrics to help ensure your settings are meeting your advertising goals and change them accordingly. Targeting the right locations for your business Get guidance on choosing the location targets that are most appropriate for your business. Compare location target types: countries, areas within a country, or radius See more details below about each location targeting level and the types of businesses that could be a good fit. Location target Description Types of businesses that could benefit Types of businesses that might not benefit Countries Targeting your ads to a country or multiple countries can be a good idea if you provide products and services to those large areas. Targeting entire countries allows you to receive more ad exposure than you would by targeting a few individual cities or regions within a country. A national business serving an entire country An online retailer shipping worldwide An international business selling to several countries A business that doesn't serve all regions or cities. In this case, you might target individual regions or cities instead. Areas within a country Consider using more precise targeting if your business doesn't serve all regions or cities, or you'd like to focus your advertising efforts on certain areas within a country. Depending on the country, you can target regions, cities, or postal codes. A business that serves a local neighborhood A business with special offers in selected locations A business selling products in selected regions or cities A business that is trying to reach most of the regions in a country, with just a few exceptions (say, all of the U.S. except for Alaska). In this case, it might be better to target the whole country, and then exclude the other areas. Radius around a location Radius targeting (also known as proximity targeting or ""Target a radius"") allows you to choose to show your ads to customers within a certain distance from your business, rather than choosing individual cities, regions, or countries. A business that delivers within a selected radius A local business whose customer base is within a radius around the business A business that only wants to reach specific cities, regions, or countries. Tips for choosing the right locations for your business What to consider when choosing your location targets: Be sure to target the locations where you can find your customers—which isn't necessarily the same place that your business is located. For example, if you own an e-commerce company, target all the locations you ship to, not just where your business is physically located. If you target an area where your business isn't located, you won't be able to see your ad when you search on Google.com. However, you can use the Ad Preview and Diagnosis Tool to find your ad. If you target a small radius or very small location, your ads might only show intermittently or not at all. That’s because small targets might not meet our targeting criteria. It's also a good idea to keep your language and location targeting settings consistent. For example, if you're targeting English-speaking users in England, remember to target the English language, and be sure that your ads are written in English. Example Adrian wants to advertise his hotel in Spain to English-speaking customers who live in England. He targets his ads to England and writes his ads in English. Set up location targeting Click an option below for location targeting instructions. Keep in mind that available location target types vary by country. Suggested time for task: 5-7 minutes Note: Google Ads only permits targeting for locations that adhere to minimum privacy thresholds where minimum area and minimum user counts are met. If your desired location target does not adhere to these privacy thresholds, then you will not be able to target it in the Google Ads interface. How to reach audiences in entire countries From the page menu on the left, click Campaigns. Click the name of the campaign that you'd like to edit. From the page menu on the left, click Settings. Click the drop-down arrow next to ""Locations."" Enter the name of the country that you'd like to target. Click Save to add the location. How to reach audiences in areas within a country It's worth keeping in mind that selecting a small location could mean that your ads might only show intermittently or not at all. That’s because small targets might not meet our targeting criteria. From the page menu on the left, click Locations. Click the name of the campaign that you'd like to edit. Click the blue pencil icon. Enter the name of the location that you'd like to target. If you're entering a city name, add the country name as well. You don't want to target Paris, France, if you're trying to sell cowboy hats to customers in Paris, Texas. Click Save to add the location. Try it now Set location targeting for multiple campaigns at once Here's how to set location targeting for multiple campaigns at the same time: From the page menu on the left, click Campaigns, then Settings. Check the box next to any campaigns that you want to change. Click the Edit drop-down menu, then choose Change locations. In the box that appears, choose whether you would like to set new locations for the selected campaigns or add new, additional locations to those campaigns. Type a location in the text field. After you select a location, additional text fields will appear where you can add more locations. Optional: We recommend you click Preview to see how your campaigns’ location will change. Click Apply. Tip While on the campaign settings page, you can click the filter icon to show only campaigns that match specific criteria. This can make it easier to make changes in bulk to certain campaigns. How to target a radius around a location Selecting a radius When you target a radius, it's worth keeping in mind that selecting a small radius could mean that your ads might only show intermittently or not at all. That’s because small targets might not meet our targeting criteria.  From the page menu on the left, click Locations.  Click the name of the campaign you wish to edit. Click the blue pencil icon, then select Radius. In the search box, enter the address of the location you'd like to use for the center of the radius. Enter the radius that you'd like to target and select a unit of measurement from the drop-down menu.  Check the map to make sure you're targeting the correct area. When you're ready, click Save to add the radius target. Click Save. Advanced: Targeting multiple locations in bulk Google Ads allows you to add a bulk list of up to 1000 location targets at a time, rather than adding each location one-by-one. We also offer tools for bulk editing. Click an option below to find out more. How to add multiple location targets in bulk From the page menu on the left, click Locations. Click the name of the campaign you wish to edit, then click the blue pencil icon. Check the box next to ""Add multiple locations."" In the box, paste or type the names of up to 1000 locations that you'd like to target (with each location on a separate line), and add locations from one country at a time. See the list of locations that can be targeted. To target more than 1000 locations, you can add location targets in bulk multiple times. For example, if you'd like to target 1200 locations, add your first 1000 location targets. When you're done, add the remaining 200 locations. To target a city or zip code, include the full name of the country or state as well—for example, Oxford, England or 94103, California. If you wish to restrict your results to one country, click the field below the location entry box and select your desired country. Click Search. We'll display all locations that matched your search in the review panel.

However, we recognize that businesses often turn to Google to find supplies, and as a result, companies selling to businesses have a lot of success advertising their products on Google. This article provides recommendations on how to optimize your account and product data to reach both businesses and individuals successfully. In your feed, submit the highest price someone could pay Both individuals and businesses will be able to search for your products. So even if the majority of your customers don't usually pay value-added tax (VAT), you must still tell all customers the highest price they could pay, including VAT if it's required for the country you're targeting To make sure your product's price is clear, your product feed should follow these recommendations: Depending on the targeted country, include any tax in the price. For most countries, this means that you need to submit the gross price of your product, which is the price including VAT. This policy does vary depending on the country you're targeting. Learn more about the tax settings The gross price in the feed must match the price on your landing page and the checkout pages on your website. Make sure that the price you submit with the price price [price] attribute matches the gross price on your landing page and the checkout pages on your website. Learn more about landing page requirements Submit the total price for the minimum number of items sold. Submit the total price an individual would pay when purchasing the minimum amount of items, for example, if your product is sold in bulk. For certain product categories, you may submit a unit price. Learn more about the unit pricing measure [unit_pricing_measure] attribute Include the prepackaged measurements of an item if applicable. For products that rely on unit pricing, you may need to include measurements such as prepackaged weight or volume. You can include per unit (US only) or per quantity information (US, EU, and Switzerland only) using the unit pricing measure [unit_pricing_measure] attribute. Keep in mind that you must also use the unit pricing base measure [unit_pricing_base_measure] attribute. Learn more about the unit pricing base measure [unit_pricing_base_measure] attribute Make your landing page clear Build your landing page to serve both business and individual customers by following these recommendations: Include a clear return and refund policy on your landing page. Your customers should be able to easily find your return and refund policy. Include a prominent link to the policies on your landing page. The policy should also be easy for your customers to understand. Learn more about misrepresentation of self or product policy Prominently show the gross price, including the value-added tax (VAT), if legally required for the country you're targeting. On your landing page, display the gross price, which is the price including the VAT, more prominently than any other price on the page. Keep in mind that this price should match the price submitted in the data feed. For example, to display the gross price more prominently, you can display it above or to the left of the net price. You might also use a larger font size and weight. If this is not the price that businesses will pay, then call out the gross price as the ""price for individuals."" Learn more about the the price [price] attribute (Optional) Show the net price, excluding VAT. If you also need to show the net price, which is the price excluding VAT, then make sure that the net price is less prominent than the gross price. For example, you might use a smaller font size and weight to display the net price. Use microdata to indicate the gross price. To make sure that Google can accurately find the price on your landing page, use microdata to indicate which price on the page is the price you submitted to Google. Typically, this is your gross price, but remember that these prices must match. To indicate the price, mark it up with: itemprop='price'. Learn more about using microdata Learn more about landing page requirements Allow everyone to checkout Here are recommendations for your checkout process to meet the needs of both businesses and individuals: Make your checkout process secure. To protect all of your possible customers, you'll need a secure checkout process that is protected with a valid SSL certificate. Specifically, you'll need to secure payment processing, transaction processing, and all personal information. Tell customers about minimum order values. If you require a minimum order value, set it in your shipping settings. For example, if you require that customers order products for at least 30 EUR on your website, add a corresponding minimum order value to your shipping settings. Learn more about how to add a minimum order value Allow individuals to purchase products. Individuals who are not part of a business need to be able to purchase from your website. For example, business-related fields such as company name or ID number should be optional. Learn more about the abuse of the network policy Tip If you still need to require certain fields for businesses, then we recommend that you create 2 checkout flows: 1 for individuals and 1 for businesses. For example, have customers select ""Individual"" or ""Business"" from a menu, and then hide the business-related fields from the individual. Here are some common company ID numbers that individuals won't have: BTW-Nummer, Numero de TVA, Registro Federal de Contribuyentes, SIREN, SIRET, Umsatzsteuer-Identifikationsnummer, and VAT Reg Number. Submit the highest shipping cost someone could pay Accurate shipping cost is critical for both individuals and businesses when making a purchase, so optimize the shipping information you provide by following these recommendations: Provide the shipping cost when targeting these countries. Customers will be able to see the shipping cost in your ads when they search on Google in these countries: Australia Austria Belgium Czechia France Germany Ireland Israel Italy Netherlands Poland South Korea Spain Switzerland United Kingdom United States Provide direct-to-individual rates. Provide the shipping rate that you charge individuals, rather than the rate that you charge businesses. Deliver to a user’s address within the country of sale. Make sure that your products are available for purchase everywhere within the country of sale and you deliver to a user’s home address. There are a few exceptions to this requirement: In the United States, Australia and Japan you can specify that you deliver only to specific regions or postal codes. In all other countries, you must provide shipping to the user’s address in the entire country of sale. Learn more about shipping settings In Sweden, Norway and Finland we allow shipping to a collection point for specific country based carriers. Learn more about the shipping [shipping] attribute In Chile and Argentina we allow delivery to collection points or store pickup. Learn more about the shipping [shipping] attribute Include handling and insurance fees. If you charge additional fees such as a service fee, handling and insurance, then include those fees in your shipping cost. Overestimate costs if necessary. If you can't get an accurate shipping cost, then provide an overestimated cost based on the average cost individuals visiting your site from Shopping ads would pay. Collect the appropriate amount of tax and shipping. No matter what tax and shipping amount you provide to Google, you're still responsible for collecting the appropriate amount of tax and shipping costs from your customers.

When you create a Video campaign, you can choose from different campaign goals, campaign subtypes, and ad formats that tell people about your products and services and get them to take action. Video ads formats, marketing objectives & campaign creations To see subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the ""Settings"" icon at the bottom of the video player, then select ""Subtitles/CC"" and choose your language. What you’ll learn A successful Video campaign should include the right targeting, bidding, budget, and ads to reach your goal. This article guides you through the process of creating a Video campaign: Choose a goal Spend your budget effectively Reach people searching for your brand or business Organize your ads with ad groups Create relevant ads Instructions 1. Choose a goal When creating a new Video campaign in your Google Ads account, you’ll select one of these campaign goals: Sales, Leads, Website traffic, Product and brand consideration, and Brand awareness and reach. The goal you select should align with what you want to achieve with your campaign. For example, if you want to encourage people to visit your website, you can select Website traffic. Learn more about Video campaign goals The goal you choose also determines the campaign subtype you can choose. A campaign subtype determines the ad formats you can use in the campaign to better optimize your campaign towards the goal. For example, if your overall goal is to get people to visit your website and encourage them to make a purchase, you’d select the Drive conversions campaign subtype. Create a new campaign and set a goal Sign in to your Google Ads account. Select Campaigns. Click the plus icon , then select New campaign. Choose your campaign goal: Sales, Leads, Website traffic, Product and brand consideration, or Brand awareness and reach. The goal you select determines the campaign subtypes available. If you don’t have a campaign goal in mind, choose Create a campaign without a goal’s guidance. Under the “Select a campaign type” section, select Video. Under the “Select a campaign subtype” section, select a campaign subtype. See how each subtype can help you reach your specific advertising goals: Drive conversions: Drive sales and leads with action-focused ads and targeting. Custom video campaign: Customize your settings with different ad types. Video reach campaign: Get the most reach for your budget. Within this campaign subtype, you can choose to reach more unique users using bumper ads, skippable in-stream ads, or an optional mix of both formats (Efficient reach), or choose to reach users with your entire message using non-skippable in-stream ads (Non-skippable in-stream). Influence consideration: Get people to consider your product with your ads. Outstream: Tailor your ads to phones and tablets. Ad sequence: Tell a story with a series of ads in a sequence. Shopping: Promote your products and get people to shop on your website. Click Continue. 2. Spend your budget effectively Your budget influences how often your ads show and how prominently they’re featured. Your bidding determines the way your budget is spent. You can choose to put your money towards getting people to see your ad, click your ad, or make a conversion on your site. Learn more about campaign budgets and bidding. Set up your bid strategy and budget Choose your bid strategy. Your bid strategy is how you optimize bids to meet your advertising goals. For example, your bid strategy lets us know if your goal is to get views (CPV), get impressions (CPM), get as many conversions at the target cost-per-action you set (CPA), or get the most conversions within your budget. Enter your budget. You can choose a campaign total budget (the amount you’d like to spend on the entire campaign) or a daily budget (the average amount you want to spend each day). Campaign total budget Google Ads will try to spend your total budget evenly over the duration of your campaign while taking into account higher and lower traffic days to optimize your campaign’s performance. You’ll only be billed up to the amount you enter for a campaign, even if Google Ads serves more views or impressions than your budget allows.   Daily budget On days when you’re more likely to get clicks and conversions, you may spend more. However, over the course of the month, your budget will average out to the amount you enter in Google Ads. Set a start date and end date for your campaign (required if you use a campaign total budget). If your campaign spends the budget fully, either reaching the daily limit (for daily budgets) or the average per day budget (for campaign total budgets), think about increasing your budget to scale your success. If not, adjust your targeting, bidding, and ads to see if your campaign performs better. 3. Reach people searching for your brand or business In your campaign, you can reach people in a certain location, those who speak a specific language, or those with a particular interest using campaign targeting. Google Ads also allows you to add content exclusions to your campaigns, so that you can make sure your ads don’t run next to sensitive content. Learn more about targeting. Set up campaign targeting Choose the networks where you want your ads to run. A network is a place where your ads can appear. For ads, these can include:  YouTube search results Your ads can appear next to search results on YouTube. This option is only available for campaigns using in-feed video ads.   YouTube videos Your ads can appear on YouTube videos, channel pages, and the YouTube homepage.    Video partners on the Display Network Otherwise known as Google video partners, your ads can appear on sites and apps on the Display Network. It’s recommended to keep this option selected, as it can help you expand your reach beyond YouTube. Select the language preferences for your ads. Depending on the languages you select, your ads will show to people who visit sites and apps that match the languages. Learn more about language targeting Select the geographic locations of the users to whom your ads will appear. Learn more about location targeting Choose your content exclusion settings, which lets you opt out of showing your campaigns alongside content that may not be appropriate for your brand or product. Inventory types With inventory types, you can opt out of groups of sensitive content that don’t align with the brand or message of your campaign. Learn more about inventory types   Excluded types and labels Select content types and digital content labels to exclude from your Video campaign. For example, you can exclude your ads from running next to live streaming videos or content labeled for mature audiences. Learn more about content types and digital content labels (Optional) Click Additional settings to set up device-specific targeting, limit how frequently your ads show to people, or set up an ad schedule. After you set up campaign targeting, you’ll set up ad group targeting. 4. Organize your ads with ad groups You can create ad groups to organize your ads by a common theme. For example, if you sell desserts, beverages, and snacks on your website, you could create 3 ad groups for each product category. With ad groups, you can refine your targeting to better reach your intended audience. Define the people that you want to reach with your ads. You can choose from: Demographics: With demographic targeting, you can reach people who are likely to be in demographic groups that you choose, including age, gender, parental status, or household income. Learn more about demographic targeting. Audiences: Audiences are groups of people with specific interests, intents, and demographics, as estimated by Google. Learn more about audience targeting. Narrow your targeting by adding relevant keywords, topics, and placements. Now that you’ve set up your targeting, you can begin creating your ads. 5. Create relevant ads When creating your ads, focus on giving your ads relevant headlines, call-to-actions, and other creative features that inspire your viewers to take action. Create your ads Search for a video that you’ve uploaded to YouTube, or enter the video URL from YouTube. Choose an eligible ad format. You’ll see a message in Google Ads if a specific ad format is not eligible for the campaign. Depending on the goal that you selected, you can choose: Skippable in-stream ads Non-skippable in-stream ads In-feed video ads Bumper ads Outstream ads Enter the final URL, which is the landing page you want people to reach when they click your ad. By default, only the domain shows up in the text of your ad. So, if your final URL is “www.example.com/shoes”, your ad will show “www.example.com”. To show more of the URL in your ad, add a display URL. Enter the display URL, which can be a different version of the final URL, or the same as the final URL. The display URL will not affect the page that people land on when clicking your ad. Enter a call-to-action, which should be compelling and direct people to the website specified in the final URL. Enter a headline, which will appear as the primary line of text that promotes your product or service. (Optional) Click Ad URL options (advanced) to add a tracking template, final URL suffix, or custom parameters to the final URL. Tracking parameters can help you track where your traffic is coming from, such as mobile devices. Add a companion banner to generate an image or a group of images that appear next to your video. Companion banners appear on computers only. You can select either an image that's automatically generated from the videos in your YouTube channel (recommended), or an image that you manually upload as your companion banner. Enter a name for your ad. If the ad looks good, click Create campaign. What’s next Once you've finished setting up your campaign, it may take a few days for your ads to start showing. Ads are typically approved within a day. It may take longer for bidding to fully optimize performance. Optimize your Video campaign Want to make your Video campaigns even better?

Structured data markup is a machine-readable representation of your product data directly on your site. The markup that's added to your HTML helps Google and other search engines understand and process your content reliably. Learn more about setting up structured data for Merchant Center on your site You can use schema.org structured annotations to allow Google to reliably retrieve up-to-date information directly from your website. In Merchant Center, the structured annotations can be used to update your product data and simplify the creation and maintenance of your product feed. Valid structured markup allows us to read your product data and enable two features: Automatic item updates: Automatic item updates reduce the risk of account suspension and item disapproval due to price and availability mismatches. Automated feeds: Available via the “website crawl” input method to create a primary feed in your Merchant Center account. Learn more about automated feeds How structured data markup works   Google Ads Help: Simplify product feed management To see subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the ""Settings"" icon at the bottom of the video player, then select ""Subtitles/CC"" and choose your language.   Structured data markup is an annotation system that you can add to your website. Structured data lets Google and other web platforms automatically read your site and directly pull product data from your HTML. Schema.org is a collection of structured data markup and annotations that are supported and used by major search engines and web platforms, including Google. To troubleshoot structured data related issues, we recommend using Search Console or the Rich Results Tool. Automatic item updates with structured data markup Prevent item disapprovals due to mismatched price and availability information with automatic item updates. This feature allows Merchant Center to update your items based on the structured data on your website in case the product data provided is out-of-date. Note: Automatic item updates are not a replacement for providing regular updates to the Merchant Center product data. Build feeds with structured data markup If you’ve annotated your website with structured data, you can use “website crawl” when selecting a feed input method to have Google create a product data feed based on the structured data you’ve provided on your website. Learn more about automated feeds Requirements for structured data markup Structured data markup must be present in the HTML returned from the web server. Structured data markup can’t be generated with Javascript after the page is loaded. Your landing page cannot change based on information about the customer, such as if you adapt prices based on a customer’s IP address or browser type. Structured data must match the values that are shown to the customer. Providing incorrect data on your product landing pages is a violation of our web developer guidelines.

The global pandemic has launched humanity into a period of great uncertainty. Many of us are questioning mortality, our place in society and other existential questions related to faith and spirituality. For Concordia students contemplating these issues there is the Multi-faith and Spirituality Centre (MFSC). It’s a home on campus for those who wish to celebrate the human essence, whether spiritual, secular or religious. Seeing the larger picture MFSC chaplain and coordinator Ellie Hummel believes that one of the core elements of spirituality is seeing oneself in the larger picture. “We bring people together in a space where they can explore topics of faith and spirituality and share with open arms and without judgement, so that we can contemplate the overall arc of life. It’s about creating deep, healthy reflection in a fun and relaxed environment.” Such exploration is especially important now. “Living in ambiguity is not easy; we are always looking for clear answers. Spiritual practice is about learning to live with uncertainty and the unknown,” Hummel adds. Since the closing of MFSC physical spaces in mid-March, the centre has moved online. Weekly activities include conversation cafés with guests. The cafés explore a range of topics such as curiosity, life stories, advocacy, photography and sacred walking. The centre also hosts meet-up lounge discussions, a weekly pause for reflection and special events such as a mid-term chill. One-one-one conversations can also be arranged. A strong community dedicated to growth, understanding and kinship At the heart of the MFSC’s appeal is the sense of community it fosters among students. Azfar Adib, a PhD candidate in electrical and computer engineering, came to Concordia from Bangladesh two years ago. At the time, he was looking for activities beyond the classroom. He discovered the MFSC and, soon after, whole new worlds. “Coming from a majority-Muslim country, it was the first time I could explore so many different beliefs,” he says. “Being part of this community has widened my thinking as well as my circle of friends, with whom I can share ideas with.” Sai Niranjan Jyothimahalingam, a master’s student in aerospace engineering, discovered the centre when he attended Graduate School Base Camp. He considers himself spiritual but not religious and contends that MFSC events are some of the best places on campus to have conversations and make connections. “Having an online space to discuss interesting topics with great people has been very helpful since the beginning of the pandemic,” Jyothimahalingam notes. “It is a safe space that has helped me gain perspective on the situation we are living through. Plus, I get to see people other than my roommates!” Your turn to discover the Multi-faith and Spirituality Centre The Discover Multi-faith Fair will take place virtually this year from November 10 to 12 and include three days of reflections, interactions, games and learning. This is an opportunity for Concordia students to engage with practitioners of various faiths and spiritual and philosophical backgrounds in a fun and inclusive environment. Register today for the virtual Discover Multi-faith Fair, taking place from November 10 to 12.   Related topics 	 religion 	 	 COVID-19 	 	 community 	 You might also like: New to Concordia?

Understanding your performance by location can help you allocate more of your online advertising efforts and budget in regions where your business is the most successful. We've listed some handy tips below to help you refine your location targeting. Note: Hotel Ads campaigns can be targeted and excluded by country or territory only. View performance by location You can use your geographic performance data to confirm that your ads are appearing in certain locations, as well as compare how your ads are performing in different locations. Use this information to pinpoint the areas that you'd like to focus on, and check out the tips in this list to help you make your ads more effective in each area. Example You have a campaign that targets the entire country of Japan, but you're located in a different country. By viewing your geographic performance data, you confirm that your ads are getting impressions in cities throughout Japan. Also, you find that your ads do better in Tokyo and Kyoto, so you decide to come up with a new advertising strategy that targets those areas. Assign more or less of your budget to certain areas If your campaign is performing better in certain areas, you may want to run separate campaigns targeted only to the more successful areas.This allows you to increase your keyword bids and budgets to maximize ad impressions in high-performing cities. Likewise, consider creating a separate campaign that targets areas outside of your top-performing cities. You may want to use the same keywords as your other campaigns, but set lower keyword bids. Example You've been targeting the entire United States in your snorkeling equipment ad campaign, but you sell most of your snorkeling equipment to customers in Hawaii. You create a separate campaign targeting only Hawaii so you can easily see how your campaign performs in that state, and then adjust your budget accordingly. Write ad text that stands out in certain geographic areas Highlight unique selling points of your business, such as certain products or services that are more likely to interest customers in those areas. You can also offer promotions available only to certain areas. Example You find that your online clothing store sells the most red mittens to people in the state of Minnesota. To attract customers in Minnesota, you create an ad targeted to Minnesota customers that promotes your red mittens. Use location-specific landing pages If you have different landing pages on your website for each region that you serve, send customers to the landing page most relevant to their geographic areas. That way, they don't have to spend time searching for the information that's relevant to them. Example You're a real estate agent and your website has listings for apartments for sale throughout Florida. If a customer is searching for apartments in Miami, you'll want to send them to your landing page with Miami apartments, rather than Orlando apartments. Use location extensions to highlight your business address If it's important for your customers to know where your business is located, it can be helpful to add location extensions to your ads. Location extensions merge your business address and phone number seamlessly with your ad text. If all of the businesses in your location extensions are in the U.S., you can target a radius around your location extensions to show ads to people located near your business. With bid multipliers, you can also set different bids for these areas. Example Let's say you own a bicycle repair shop in downtown Chicago. With location extensions, a customer near your store who searches for bicycle repair shops can see your ad, along with your full address and phone number, and head your way with his flat tire. Exclude regions that don't perform well If you're consistently getting clicks with a low conversion rate from certain regions, or clicks from regions where you don't want your ads to show, consider excluding these regions from your targeting. Example If you've been targeting the entire United States, but you find that clicks from Wyoming aren't converting well for your business, you can exclude Wyoming to avoid showing your ads for that state.

Site search Concordia Directories Search Coronavirus (COVID-19) Concordia.ca 	 	  /  	 Coronavirus (COVID-19) 	 	  /  	 Updates 	 How one engineering grad sets Montrealers’ wheels in motion Jody Arsenault’s mobile bike business has been in high demand during the pandemic September 3, 2020 | By Samia Aladas, BFA 96 Source: University Advancement Stationed in a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van, ArsenoVelo is a fully mobile business. With some travel restrictions still in place because of COVID-19, many Montrealers have made the most of warmer weather on two wheels. As a result, for mountain bike enthusiast Jody Arsenault, BEng 12, it’s been a busy season at ArsenoVelo, the mobile bike service and repair shop he opened in 2016. “This year has been extreme,” Arsenault says. “With COVID-19, the demand has just been incredible — I could not have guessed this would have happened.” The motivation to start his own business wasn’t hard to come by. “I’ve always been a make-my-own-path type of person,” he says. “I thought of ways to open and start my own company and, given my experience, it was somewhat of an easy transition.” Following his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering at Concordia’s Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science, Arsnenault completed a certificate in bicycle mechanics from the Winterborne Bicycle Institute. With the help of his business partner and wife, Caroline Villard, things at ArsenoVelo are looking good. Business on the go Being mobile was always at the base of ArsenoVelo’s business plan. The service shop is stationed in a large cargo van, so that Arsensault can pick up and drop off his customers’ bikes at their desired location — at various points around Montreal or on the city’s South Shore. According to Arsenault, mobile businesses are on the rise, now, more than ever. “It’s just the mentality of today,” he says. “With the Amazon market, everyone expects everything to come to them. Shopping online is definitely increasing, so we’re going to see more of these ‘catered-to-the-client’ business models.” In light of the pandemic, a mobile service is ideal for Arsenault since there is little to no person-to-person contact and because it offers more convenient schedules. “Getting to the customers has been easier since a lot of them are at home. In the past, most of my appointments were in the evenings. Now my clients are a little more flexible so I can actually get through my days quicker.” ‘I learned a great deal from my failures and setbacks’ To manage the increase in demand for bike repairs during the pandemic, Arsenault has been able to hire additional staff for the first time. Three engineering students — including two from Concordia, as well as one high-school student — have joined the ArsenoVelo team. “I’ve always been a make-my-own-path type of person,” says Jody Arsenault, owner and founder of ArsenoVelo. Looking back at his own time as a student, Arsenault acknowledges the valuable learning he gained with Concordia’s Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Baja team. “When I was at SAE, there was a lot of hands-on experience with cutting and welding steel, as well as with fabrication, which greatly helped in dealing with the initial setup and build of my mobile van,” he says. Arsenault also played for the Stingers men’s rugby team for three seasons during his studies. The team won the 2005-06 championships and Arsenault was named an all-star in 2009.  Whether it was through his involvement with SAE, the Stingers or pursuing his engineering degree, Arsenault attributes the success of ArsenoVelo to his student experience. “I think what I took away the most was my work ethic,” he says. “Concordia gave me the opportunity to fail. I faced a lot of challenges while there and I learned a great deal from my failures and setbacks. I also learned what it takes to succeed.” Related topics 	 engineering 	 	 community 	 	 alumni 	 	 COVID-19 	 Trending November 30: Join the global Giving Tuesday movement ‘Concordia gave me everything, even language’ ‘Your support changed my life’ Back to top © Concordia University Concordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424 About Academics Admissions Campus life Research International Careers Future students Current students Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Sir George Williams Campus 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W.

This information is shown to users. When to use Required for each product If the cost per unit is important to your price information, also consider submitting the unit pricing measure [unit_pricing_measure] and unit pricing base measure [unit_pricing_base_measure]attributes. Format Follow these formatting guidelines to make sure Google understands the data you're submitting. For details on when and how to submit values in English, learn more about submitting your product data Type Number plus currency (use ISO 4217) Repeated field No Schema.org property (What's this?) Offer.priceSpecification, Type: PriceSpecification File format Example entry Text feeds 15.00 USD XML feeds <g:price>15.00 USD</g:price> To format your data for Content API, see the Content API for Shopping. Guidelines Follow these guidelines to make sure you submit high-quality data for your products. Minimum requirements These are the requirements you'll need to meet to show your product. If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in the Diagnostics page in your Merchant Center account. Make sure that the price in your product data meets both the landing page and checkout requirements. Learn more about landing page requirements Submit an amount and currency that match the price on your landing page and the checkout pages. Learn more currency requirements for your country of sale If you charge any additional fees at checkout and they’re not included in the product price, make sure to include these charges in Merchant Center by combining them with the applicable shipping costs either via the shipping [shipping] attribute or using the Merchant Center shipping services. Include the price in the currency of your country of sale prominently on your landing page and checkout pages. Don’t change the price of your product on your landing page based on a user’s location. Ensure that users can purchase the product online for the price that you submit, regardless of their location. Display variants and prices in a straightforward way on your landing page. Display the submitted product and price prominently on your landing page. If you have multiple variants on your landing page, make sure the submitted product and corresponding price are the most prominent. Charge the submitted price to all users in the country of sale unless regional pricing is available in your country of sale. Learn more about regional availability and pricing Make sure that any user in the country of sale can buy the product for the submitted price without paying for a membership. Membership prices are allowed in ads or listings only if the following conditions are met: There is no cost to sign up and membership is available to everyone with no contingencies. The signup process is straightforward and can be completed on the landing page or during checkout. The discounted price with membership is clearly displayed on the landing page. Include any minimum order value in your shipping settings. Learn more about how to add a minimum order value Don’t submit products with a price that constantly changes such as auctions and prices based on a live currency exchange. If your product’s price changes often, you’ll need to let us know about all such price updates to be able to show your product. Don’t include shipping costs in your price. Instead, use Merchant Center shipping services or the shipping [shipping] attribute in the feed. Don’t include any import or export-related costs in your price. Instead, clearly indicate relevant charges on your website. Learn more about export charges Submit a price that’s greater than 0. Only mobile phones or tablets that are sold with a monthly installment payment and/or subscription plan can have a price of 0 if there is no up-front payment. This does not apply to Latin America, where the full cost of the product is included in the price. Learn more about requirements for advertising wireless products and services Don't provide more than 2 digits after the decimal point. If you include more than 2 digits after the decimal point, they'll automatically be rounded to the nearest acceptable value. For example, 1.0234 will be rounded to 1.02 and 29.8999 will be rounded to 29.90. Don’t include activation fees for wireless plans in the price you submit for mobile devices and tablets sold in the US. Wireless subscription plans are not supported for Shopping ads and free listings in the US. Comply with local laws when submitting price information. Best practices These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your product data for performance. Submit a price that can be represented in the currency of your country of sale (according to ISO 4217). For example, instead of 1.0012 USD, submit 1.01 USD. If your price can’t be represented in the currency of your country of sale, then we’ll round it to a value that can. Enable automatic item updates for price. Automatic item updates use the Schema.org microdata on your landing page to help keep your data fresh. Keep in mind these updates only happen when Google crawls your landing page, and you still need to resubmit your product data regularly. Learn more about enabling automatic item updates Highlight sales that promote your products. Use the sale price [sale_price] attribute to tell users how much you’re charging for your product during a sale. During the period that you specify, your sale price will show as the current price for your product. If your original and sale prices meet certain requirements, your original price may show along with the sale price, allowing people to see the difference between the two. Use currency conversion as an easy way to target a country that uses a different currency than the one on your website and in your product data. If you use currency conversion, the prices on your landing page, checkout pages, and in your product data must still match. We'll display the converted price in your ad or free listing, but the converted price doesn't need to appear on your landing page or at checkout. Learn more about currency conversion Additional guidelines Review each section closely to determine if the requirements apply to your country or product. If you don't follow requirements that apply to you, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in Diagnostics in your Merchant Center account. Business-to-business (B2B) focused retailers Submit a price that includes value-added tax (VAT) if required for your country of sale. While B2B retailers can participate in Shopping ads, free listings, and other features, if you’re required to submit VAT in the price, then make sure that the same price including VAT is visible on your landing page and at checkout. Learn more about B2B advertising Minimum order value Specify any minimum order value that you require in your shipping settings. For example, if your product costs 10 USD, and you require that users spend at least 50 USD to place an order, then that would be a minimum order value. Specify a minimum order value of 50 USD for the affected shipping service. Learn more about how to add a minimum order value Merchant-defined bundles and multipacks Submit the total price for your entire bundle or multipack. Learn more about the bundle [is_bundle] and multipack [multipack] attributes. Products sold in bulk Submit the price for the minimum number of products that you require a user to purchase. Don't submit the price for just 1 product if a user can't purchase only 1 product. For example, if you sell pens, and users must purchase at least 50 pens to place an order, then submit the price for 50 pens. Note: If you require a minimum total number of products (either multiples of the same product or a combination of different products) in order for a customer to successfully complete a purchase, declare the total minimum number of products as the minimum order value. Product samples If the product you want to show is sold only in bulk quantities, but you also allow people to purchase samples individually, you can show the sample instead of the bulk quantity. To do so, submit the price of the sample in the feed, and begin the title with sample. Products with minimum advertised pricing agreements Submit the minimum advertised pricing (MAP) value as the ‘price’ in your product data if you sell the product for less than the price allowed by third party agreements. Show the MAP price on your product landing page. You can show that you charge a lower price at checkout by adding clarifying text to your product pages. For example, you could display a note such as “Add to cart for final price” and show the MAP value crossed out or greyed out. The MAP price in your product data must show on the landing page. Learn more about requirements for landing pages If you use microdata annotations on your website, include the MAP as the price there as well. Mobile phone or tablet sold with installment payments and/or a subscription plan Submit the price as the total up-front payment (including activation fees and device down payment). The price can be as low as 0 if the price of your mobile phone or tablet is subsidized and bundled with installment payments or a subscription plan. This only applies if installment payments or subscription plans for mobile devices are allowed in the country of sale. This is not applicable to Latin America where the price is not an up-front payment, but is always the full price of the product. Learn more about requirements for advertising wireless products and services Mobile phone or tablet prepaid up-front or sold with installment payments and/or a subscription plan: Australia Submit the price as the total cost of the device and/or installment and/or wireless service payments (including activation fees). The price must be the total minimum cost that the customer must pay for the duration of the contract for the device plus installment and wireless service plan payments (if applicable). Learn more about requirements for advertising wireless products and services Mobile phone or tablet prepaid up-front or sold with installment payments and/or a subscription plan: United States Submit the price as the total up-front payment (including device down payment). Don’t include activation fees for wireless plans. Wireless subscription plans are not supported for Shopping ads and free listings in the US. The price can be as low as 0 if the price of your mobile phone or tablet is subsidized or bundled with installment payments.Learn more about requirements for advertising wireless products and services Tax: Canada and the United States Don't include any taxes, such as a Goods and Services Tax (GST), value-added tax (VAT), sales tax, or import tax, in the price [price] attribute. Learn more about how to submit taxes correctly for your country of sale Tax: Australia, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czechia, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Vietnam Provide the product price, including any value-added tax (VAT) or Goods and Services Tax (GST), in the price [price] attribute, and ensure that the landing page price matches the price in your product data. Don’t use the tax [tax] attribute. Learn more about how to submit taxes correctly for your country of sale Software subscriptions Submit the price for the full length of the software subscription, with a minimum of 1 year (12 months). If the prepaid subscription comes with any subsidized or free periods, then include those in the total price. If your subscription costs more (or less) for the first year than for the following years, submit the prepaid price for the first year. If you like, you can instead submit the prepaid price for multiple years. Learn more about submitting software subscriptions Magazine and newspaper subscriptions Submit the price for the full length of the magazine or newspaper subscription, with a minimum of 1 year (12 months). If the prepaid subscription comes with any subsidized or free periods, then include those in the total price. If your subscription costs more (or less) for the first year than for the following years, submit the prepaid price for the first year. If you like, you can instead submit the prepaid price for multiple years. Clearly state in your renewal and cancellation terms whether the subscription is for a fixed term or is automatically renewed. Also explain the cancellation options and under which conditions the auto-renewal occurs once the prepaid duration has ended. Submit shipping cost as 0 (if shipping cost is required for your target country). For example, 0.00 USD, 0.00 EUR, 0.00 GBP. You can submit shipping costs through the shipping [shipping] attribute or through your account shipping settings. Export and cross-border trade Prominently state on your website if import-related charges apply. For example, add information on your landing page or during checkout so users are aware of these costs before they place the order. Don’t submit import or export-related costs as part of the tax [tax] or price [price] attributes. Learn more about what to do when you ship across borders Understand for which country you need to meet price and tax requirements. If you choose to show a currency that is not the currency of the country of sale, you must follow the price and tax requirements for the country that your currency is native to. Examples Variants If your product comes in multiple colors or sizes, you might also have different prices for each of these variants. For example: Product data for a small Google t-shirt priced at 10.99 USD Attribute Value Title [title] Google T-Shirt - Green - Small Price [price] 10.99 USD Color [color] Green Size [size] S ID [id] 9876-S-GRN Item group ID [item_group_id] 9876   Product data for a small blue Google t-shirt priced at 8.99 USD Attribute Value Title [title] Google T-Shirt - Blue - Small Price [price] 8.99 USD Color [color] Blue Size [size] S ID [id] 9876-S-BLU Item group ID [item_group_id] 9876     Product data for a small yellow Google t-shirt priced at 10.50 USD Attribute Value Title [title] Google T-Shirt - Yellow - Small Price [price] 10.50 USD Color [color] Yellow Size [size] S ID [id] 9876-S-YELLOW Item group ID [item_group_id] 9876 Phone or tablet with installment payments (US) Product data for a midnight blue Google Pixel 3 - 32MB phone priced at 0.00 USD, with 12 monthly installment payments Attribute Value Title [title] Google Pixel 3 - 32 GB - Midnight Blue with 12 monthly payments Price [price] 0.00 USD Installment [installment] 12:29:95 USD Google product category [google_product_category] Electronics > Communications > Telephony > Mobile Phones For more examples, see best practices for advertising wireless products and services.

For example, if you sell coffee capsules that cost 2 EUR a piece and come in a sleeve of 10, you might require an MOV of 5 sleeves. Note that the MOV is calculated in Merchant Center using price rather than quantity, so you need to submit the price for 5 sleeves (100 EUR) as the MOV, rather than the number of sleeves. Here’s how to correctly submit your product data: Product data for 5 sleeves of coffee capsules, priced at 20 EUR per sleeve with an MOV of 100 EUR Attribute Value Title [title] Coffee Capsules (5 sleeves of 10 capsules) Price [price] 20.00 EUR (1 sleeve) Unit pricing measure [unit_pricing_measure] 10 ct (Optional) Unit pricing base measure [unit_pricing_base_measure] 1 ct (Optional) Shipping settings Minimum order value: 100.00 EUR Unit pricing Product data for a 30 ml Eau de Parfum priced at 43.95 EUR Attribute Value Title [title] Eau de Parfum - 30 ml Price [price] 43.95 USD Unit pricing measure [unit_pricing_measure] 30ml Unit pricing base measure [unit_pricing_base_measure] 100ml Software subscription Product data for a 1-year subscription to a Google Security Software Basic Edition priced at 29.90 USD Attribute Value Title [title] Google Security Software Basic Edition (1-year subscription) Price [price] 29.90 USD Google product category [google_product_category] Software > Computer Software > Antivirus & Security Software Brand [brand] Google MPN [mpn] 123GOOGLE432 GTIN [gtin] 1234567890123 Shipping [shipping] 0.00 USD Image link [image_link] https://www.example.com/image1.jpg Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit Need more help?

Google Online Security Blog: Trick & Treat! 🎃 Paying Leets and Sweets for Linux Kernel privescs and k8s escapes
",1,"Google Online Security Blog: Trick & Treat! 🎃 Paying Leets and Sweets for Linux Kernel privescs and k8s escapes Security Blog The latest news and insights from Google on security and safety on the Internet Trick & Treat! 🎃 Paying Leets and Sweets for Linux Kernel privescs and k8s escapes November 1, 2021 Posted by Eduardo Vela, Google Bug Hunters Team Starting today and for the next 3 months (until January 31 2022), we will pay 31,337 USD to security researchers that exploit privilege escalation in our lab environment with a patched vulnerability, and 50,337 USD to those that use a previously unpatched vulnerability, or a new exploit technique.We are constantly investing in the security of the Linux Kernel because much of the internet, and Google—from the devices in our pockets, to the services running on Kubernetes in the cloud—depend on the security of it. We research its vulnerabilities and attacks, as well as study and develop its defenses.But we know that there is more work to do. That’s why we have decided to build on top of our kCTF VRP from last year and triple our previous reward amounts (for at least the next 3 months).Our base rewards for each publicly patched vulnerability is 31,337 USD (at most one exploit per vulnerability), but the reward can go up to 50,337 USD in two cases:If the vulnerability was otherwise unpatched in the Kernel (0day)If the exploit uses a new attack or technique, as determined by GoogleWe hope the new rewards will encourage the security community to explore new Kernel exploitation techniques to achieve privilege escalation and drive quicker fixes for these vulnerabilities. It is important to note, that the easiest exploitation primitives are not available in our lab environment due to the hardening done on Container-Optimized OS. Note this program complements Android's VRP rewards, so exploits that work on Android could also be eligible for up to 250,000 USD (that's in addition to this program).The mechanics are:Connect to the kCTF VRP cluster, obtain root and read the flag (read this writeup for how it was done before, and this threat model for inspiration), and then submit your flag and a checksum of your exploit in this form.(If applicable) report vulnerabilities to upstream.We strongly recommend including a patch since that could qualify for an additional reward from our Patch Reward Program, but please report vulnerabilities upstream promptly once you confirm they are exploitable.Report your finding to Google VRP once all patches are publicly available (we don't want to receive details of unpatched vulnerabilities ahead of the public.)Provide the exploit code and the algorithm used to calculate the hash checksum.A rough description of the exploit strategy is welcome.Reports will be triaged on a weekly basis. If anyone has problems with the lab environment (if it's unavailable, technical issues or other questions), contact us on Discord in #kctf. You can read more details about the program here.

Site search Concordia Directories Search Coronavirus (COVID-19) Concordia researchers build web-based tool to reduce risk of indoor SARS-CoV-2 transmission Site offers best practices to improve building air quality and minimize cases of COVID-19 November 2, 2020 | By 		Justin Dupuis Thanks to CityRPI, users can pick any building in the Montreal region and the tool will guide them through a personalized airborne virus risk assessment. With colder weather just around the corner, Montrealers soon will be spending more and more time indoors, increasing the likelihood of a spike in COVID-19 cases in the city. To help slow the spread of the new coronavirus during the cold season, a team of researchers led by Leon Wang, associate professor of building, civil and environmental engineering at the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science, has built a web-based tool to estimate the risk of indoor airborne transmission of the virus in Montreal’s buildings. Wang, alongside PhD students Ali Katal and Maher Albettar, developed the City Reduced Probability of Infection (CityRPI) site the Concordia University Building Environment Lab. It calculates the probability of infection through aerosol transmission in indoor spaces. Wang, an expert in building airflow and thermal management, says that a proper understanding of ventilation and air quality in indoor spaces could help slow the spread of the virus. “Until recently, the importance of aerosol transmission had been overlooked, but now it’s clear that this is one of the major routes of infection, especially for poorly ventilated spaces,” he says. Leon Wang: “The website aims to help policymakers and the general public make informed decisions about how to slow the spread of airborne viruses.” | Photo by David Ward Site shares measures to reduce transmission The web-based tool calculates the probability of infection in a building by using publicly available data from building standards and codes and geographic information from various sources such as OpenStreetMap, Microsoft Building Footprints and the City of Montreal. Users can pick any building in the Montreal region. The tool will guide them through a personalized assessment, prompting them to provide information such as air exchange rates, ventilation, air filtration conditions, occupation density, staying time and whether or not occupants are required to wear a mask. “The research used to develop this tool shows that there’s a correlation between indoor airborne virus transmission risk, the number of people in a space and how long they stay there,” Wang adds. “This confirms that wearing a mask indoors can be critical in slowing the spread of the virus.” Based on the building parametres fed into the site, Wang’s tool provides a list of measures to help building owners reduce the risk of indoor infections due to airborne virus aerosols. “The website aims to provide a quality scientific method on building ventilation to help policy-makers and the general public make informed decisions about how to slow the spread of the new coronavirus from airborne aerosol transmission,” Wang notes. “Other precaution and mitigation measures must also be strictly maintained, such as social distancing and frequent disinfection, to reduce the risks due to contact and droplet transmissions indoors.” CityRPI was built using an open-source tool developed by Wang’s collaborators Shelly Miller and a team led by Jose Jimenez, both at the University of Colorado Boulder. It was funded thanks to a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. Here are some best practices to minimize the risk of airborne virus transmission indoors Wear a face mask Upgrade to high-efficiency duct filters in HVAC systems Regularly change air filters in ventilation systems and air cleaners Use portable air cleaners in poorly ventilated and/or crowded spaces Spend less time in public spaces indoors Reduce the number of occupants in a space   Check out the City Reduced Probability of Infection (CityRPI) site and find out more about Concordia’s Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science.   Related topics 	 research 	 	 engineering 	 	 COVID-19 	 	 technology 	 You might also like: Canada-wide research network based at Concordia is ready to make work surfaces safer for frontline staff Concordia engineers help develop an emergency response drone Trending Concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the Montreal Climate Partnership November 10, 2021 Improvements to Concordia’s Henry F.

She and her team started preparing last December for the upcoming round of presentations for the Capstone course, the program’s culminating seminar. But as was true for most people at the university and beyond, everything changed after the COVID-19 lockdown in March. Lagou and her John Molson CPA program colleagues were charged with quickly developing new and creative ways to deliver the Capstone course, all while keeping students engaged online. When it came time for the final presentations in June, the task of holding them virtually became a significant undertaking. The presentations are part of the CPA program’s larger Capstone module course, aimed at testing students through a complex comprehensive case analysis study, covering over 60 pages of case material. “Nothing was conceived or designed for the presentations to take place online; we were adjusting as we were delivering,” reports Lagou, who is also an accountancy lecturer in the program. She is proud to report that they ultimately pulled it off with great success. This year’s presentations consisted of the largest-ever cohort — 139 students virtually presenting their projects through Zoom to a panel of judges. Over the course of two days, Lagou and her team of two CPA program staff members, along with four IITS and one Centre for Teaching and Learning support staff, simultaneously managed five live streams of presentations every hour. “It was actually fantastic. I enjoyed being able to take part of it from the comfort of my own home,” says third-year judge of the CPA Capstone presentations, Carolyn Gass (BComm 02, GrCert 10). She explains she was hesitant to use Zoom at first but enjoyed the overall experience in the end. “It was so well organized. The IITS team had created these breakout rooms, where we would go in to discuss each presentation, and then go back to the main room where the students would be waiting for the feedback,” Gass says. “I was extremely satisfied with how it worked out.” Modifications along the way “The Capstone presentations demand teamwork. But, besides that, the rest of the program is mostly lecture-based sessions, and multiple case study exams. I had to modify my teaching methods to fit both,” Lagou notes. “As professors, we must be agile, flexible and open and adjust our rules as we go on. If we see that something is not working, we have to find better ways.” Guided by the JMSB’s most recent strategic plan, which seeks to offer a continuously relevant curriculum and adapt innovative teaching methods, Lagou revised her lectures to help her students succeed in this difficult situation. “It’s so important for the professor to continuously go back to check in and try to engage them in a different way than in a normal classroom,” she says. “I kept the sessions shorter, gave them a break halfway through our three-and-a-half-hour lectures and created weekly FAQs based on the questions asked in the chat section during our Zoom classes and the follow-up questions I received by email.” Transition to online exams Lagou explains that the John Molson CPA program has also been trying various methods to deliver online examinations. “We’ve tested everything from proctoring to COLE,” she says, referring to the Concordia OnLine Exams tool. “They each have their strengths and weaknesses, and our method isn’t bulletproof, but it works best for our purpose.” With the help of her staff, Lagou decided to monitor her students through Zoom while they all took their timed online exams. “I created rules around the Zoom exam sessions. I told them they needed to turn on their cameras while facing the screen, in order to keep an eye on them. This would maintain some control of academic integrity, without recording or invading their personal privacy,” she says. This is all in preparation for the CPA Canada Common Final Examinations that her students will take in September. “When they get their exams graded, we have them meet their exam marker individually over Zoom to discuss their strengths and weaknesses in order to continue preparing them for the national exam,” Lagou explains. “The students were so relieved to be able to continue with their academic progression, rather than stopping the program.” Positive feedback from students For Lagou, ensuring a good student experience during the live virtual Capstone presentations was a top priority — something she believes they achieved. “It can create a more laid-back atmosphere than when you’re presenting in person in front of three judges,” she says. Marie-li Evangeliste, a student in the CPA program, echoes Lagou’s words. “It was more relaxing for me because I didn’t see the judge in person. I didn’t have all the stress of presenting in front of a live panel,” Evangeliste says. “The interaction was different — the camera on the computer became the eye-contact part of the presentation.” Aziz Mussayev (BComm 19) is another CPA program student. “In a way, it prepared us for the future, since more businesses and firms are moving to online work. I got to learn about different platforms like Microsoft Teams and Zoom, which will all be quite useful,” he says. Evangeliste agrees. “It was different, but in the end, I still learned a lot from it.” Find out more about Concordia’s Chartered Professional Accountancy program at the John Molson School of Business.     Related topics 	 students 	 	 COVID-19 	 	 business 	 You might also like: Concordia’s John Molson Executive Centre soars to online success Trending Concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the Montreal Climate Partnership November 10, 2021 Improvements to Concordia’s Henry F.

For example, a T-shirt might have a logo of a sports team, and so you might submit bears or tigers. This information helps create accurate filters, which customers can use to narrow search results. If your product has variants that vary by pattern, then provide that information through this attribute. When to use Required for all products that vary by pattern Optional for any products where pattern is an important, distinguishing feature If the pattern is an important feature of your product, then submit this attribute. For example, a dress might come in ""polka dot"", ""striped"", and ""paisley"". We especially recommend that you submit the pattern [pattern] attribute if customers might search for your product by pattern or if they might decide to buy your product based on the pattern. Format Follow these formatting guidelines to make sure Google understands the data you're submitting. For details on when and how to submit values in English, learn more about submitting your product data Type Unicode characters (Recommended: ASCII only) Limits 0–100 characters Repeated field No Schema.org property (What’s this?) Product.pattern, Type: Text File format Example entry Text feeds Striped XML feeds <g:pattern>Striped</g:pattern> To format your data for Content API, see the Content API for Shopping. Guidelines Follow these guidelines to make sure you submit high-quality data for your products. Minimum requirements These are the requirements you'll need to meet to show your product. If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in the Diagnostics page in your Merchant Center account. Include the pattern or graphic on your product. Don’t include values that belong in other attributes such as color, size, or material. Submit a pattern for all products that vary by pattern. Use the pattern [pattern] attribute when your product is a variant that’s distinguished by its pattern (for example, polka dots and stripes), and also submit each variant with the same value for the item group ID [item_group_id] attribute. Submit only one value. Only one value will be accepted in the pattern field and any subsequent entries will be ignored. Best practices These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your product data for performance. Use a value users will be able to understand. The value you submit can be shown to users, so avoid abbreviations or internal terms. For example, don’t submit ""plka"" if you mean polka dots, and don’t submit ""strpd"" if you’re referring to a striped shirt. Don’t use values that don’t mention the pattern. This attribute is optional, so if it isn't relevant for your product, then don’t use it. For example, don’t submit values like ""n/a"", ""none"", ""multi"", or ""other"". Examples Variants If your product has variants of different patterns, submit the patterns for each variant.

Covid-19AboutAboutHistoryOur TeamFrequently asked questionsPromotional materialAnnual reportsJob opportunitiesContact 211FrançaisCommunity organizations and food relief According to the organization Les Banques alimentaires du Québec, 372,064 food baskets are distributed each month throughout the province, nearly half of which are distributed to families with children. Food items come from donations, large-scale collection campaigns, retrieval of supermarket surpluses or even purchases, and they are delivered on a regular or a one-time basis to low-income individuals and families who request them. This aid can be distributed through food banks, solidarity grocery stores, food vouchers or health baskets. Food aid enrollment To enroll in a food aid service with an organization, you may need to become a member and purchase a membership card, which can be renewed annually and costs between $5 and $20. Some organizations also require proof of income and residence in order to provide the services to those who are less fortunate in the neighborhood. It is therefore very important to check the geographical area served by an organization before submitting an application for food aid. Sometimes, a delivery service can be offered to individuals with reduced mobility. To benefit from this, it may be required to assess the situation at home. Food Banks Food available Cost Find Organizations in Greater Montreal Caning Bread Pasta Juices and snacks Some vegetables  Free or voluntary contribution of 2$ to 5$  Search for Food Banks In most cases, collected food is distributed in the form of free bags, even if some organizations ask for a voluntary contribution or a symbolic amount ranging from $2 to $5. These bags can contain cans, sliced bread, vegetables, snacks, juice boxes, pasta, salad dressings, yogurt, and other perishable and non-perishable foods. The size of the bags depends on the size of the family. For example, a family of two adults and one child will get a bag of provisions that is proportionally smaller than one given to a family with several children; however, it will be larger than the bag of a person living alone. Although the amount of food received is not always the same, it is usually possible to prepare 2 or 3 meals for the whole family after a visit to a food bank. For most organizations, distribution is done on a weekly or monthly basis. This means that people wishing to receive food aid must visit the organization’s premises during the distribution to receive their bags. To ensure that baskets are available, it is preferable to call and make an appointment before going. To this end, Food banks of Quebec is a large network of regional organizations involved in distributing food, while also providing food assistance services to the population in each region of the province of Quebec. Composed of Moisson et Associé members, this network serves some 1,064 local non-profit organizations. Moisson members are regional food banks that act as sorting centres. They have an important infrastructure and provide at least 75% of the redistribution of food products to local organizations, as well as 25% of food assistance to people in need. It is therefore possible to get food baskets through food counters set up by these organizations. Emergency If you are in an urgent situation and you are temporarily unable to feed your family or yourself, you can call an emergency food service near you. Offered on an occasional basis, this service, when available, allows for food aid requests from people going through difficult times, even outside of product distribution time slots. When you make such a request to a food bank, the food bank will assess your situation and needs in order to help you through this difficult time. Low-price food stores Food available Cost Find Organizations in Greater Montréal Person's choice: Fresh Food Non-perishable goods About 10% of the actual cost of the grocery store Search for Low-price food stores Some food safety organizations offer users a solidarity grocery service that offers non-perishable foods at a fraction of the actual value of the basket in a supermarket. These low-cost community grocery stores allow you to choose your own basket of provisions. This works like Magasins-Partage for Christmas and Back to School periods which sell toys and school supplies at a low price and which makes it possible to get food to prepare a good holiday meal or to fill children’s lunch boxes. This is given in exchange for a 10% contribution to the actual cost at the grocery store. Food vouchers Food available Amount Allocated Find Organizations in Greater Montréal At the choice of the person in an affiliated grocery store Between 30$ and 50$ for a single person Approximately 20$ per additional person Search for Food Vouchers If food banks and low-cost food stores provide food directly to the public, other organizations will favour the distribution of vouchers that can be exchanged for food in participating grocery stores. This is the case for the Société Saint-Vincent de Paul, which, in addition to distributing products, offers a food voucher service. Operated by a large network of volunteers, this organization provides food aid to Montreal, Laval and the MRC de L’Assomption, because of a territorial subdivision defined by the parish system. On the other hand, the same service is not available everywhere in these regions: some sectors are simply not served by the Société Saint-Vincent de Paul, while others offer food aid in the form of food bags exclusively. If you wish to benefit from this service, an assessment of your needs will be carried out according to your income in order to ensure your eligibility. If necessary, a food voucher will be given to you. Depending on several factors, the amount of this check varies. It is usually between $30 and $50 for a single person and that amount increases by $20 per additional person in the household. In addition, you may be given a bag of non-perishable food so that your voucher is primarily intended to purchase fresh grocery products. In all cases, these amounts are determined on a case-by-case basis and may differ from one service point of the Société Saint-Vincent de Paul to another. If you do not know the name of your parish and if you live in the regions of Montreal or Laval, it is possible to find a service point by searching your postal code on the website: https://ssvp-mtl.org/en/food-aid Good Food Box Food available Cost Find Organizations in Greater Montréal Vegetables and fresh fruit Good Food Box or Boit’appétit (Laval, Lanaudière): 8$ - Single Person 12$ - Couple 18$ - Family Search for good food boxes Finally, a different form of food distribution consists of making available baskets of fresh produce at low prices, such as fruits and vegetables, from local farms. The Good Food Box or Boit’appétit services, supported by several organizations in the regions of Laval, Lanaudière and the Laurentians, is certainly one of the pioneers in this field. This service offers different drop-off points where it is possible to get good food boxes. Unfortunately, on the island of Montreal, after the definitive shutdown of this service in 2016 due to a lack of funding, very few organizations are distributing fresh products. Among them, Le Sésame offers a variety of food safety services and provides consumers with economic baskets of fresh fruits and vegetables, saving between 25% and 40% of the price paid at the grocery store. Similarly, it is also possible, through the organization Équiterre, to be referred to drop off locations where you can buy baskets of organic foods from local farms close to home. In addition to low-cost baskets of fruit and vegetables, other solutions exist to overcome the problem of food deserts characterized by the absence of shops selling fresh produce in the vicinity. External markets like Marché solidaire Frontenac and Santropol Roulant Farmers’ Market all sell good products at a low cost and aim to provide the population with accessible healthy foods in their neighborhood. Food purchase groups A purchasing group pools orders from several people and families and allows its members to buy quality food. Significant savings can be made, because of the elimination of middlemen and the possibility to purchase larger quantities of food. In the same way, using collective kitchens makes it possible to share the costs of dishes prepared in groups. Coming together to save money is the solution favoured by these initiatives! Other food aid services While all the services mentioned are intended to provide food assistance to low-income individuals in Greater Montréal, organizations which provide them generally have a broader mission aimed at the social integration of their users. In this perspective, these services are often accompanied by personalized support and an overall assessment of needs.  As for material assistance, many places donate or sell clothes, household items or furniture at a low cost. In terms of the social dimension, food aid is a gateway to the activities offered by the organizations, thus breaking down isolation and forging links with the community. But food distribution is not the only way to provide food aid. Indeed, many community resources specialize in the preparation and distribution of meals (lien article sur les repas). In addition, some services are specialized in terms of the clientele they serve, such as family organizations offering food for pregnant women and infants (lien article aliments pour bébés). Others distribute food products according to their vocation, just like organizations providing Christmas baskets containing traditional foods for low-income individuals.     [1] Les Banques alimentaires du Québec, www.banquesalimentaires.org Partners© IRCGM 2018 - All rights reserved - Login - Website by:MG2 Media Accessibility | Terms"

A vaccine (also known as an immunization) is a preparation that, when administered to a person, improves the ability of their immune system to fight germs that cause a disease. Therefore, vaccines can prevent certain illnesses, some of which are life-threatening. Keeping your vaccines up-to-date will help you stay healthy all year long. While vaccination is not mandatory in Canada, Concordia University Health Services strongly recommends everyone keep their vaccinations up-to-date. Unfortunately, many Concordians have not received all the vaccines that are recommended by public health experts. Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses occur on Canadian and U.S. campuses every year, including measles, mumps, chicken pox, meningitis, and of course, Covid-19.  Keeping your vaccines up-to-date Your vaccination records If you're moving to Montreal for university, it's important to be informed about your vaccine history. Before you leave home, make sure to: Review your vaccine history with your health care provider and update any vaccines you’re missing. Vaccines can be costly, and student insurance plans do not offer the same coverage that employee or family plans pay for. Start early, as some vaccines require a series of shots and may take a few weeks or months to complete. Pack your vaccine records (or a clear copy or photo). Every university student should have this vital information easily accessible.  Routine adult vaccination program Concordia Health Services offers a routine adult vaccination program, through which you can make an appointment with a nurse to: Ask questions and discuss any concerns you have regarding vaccines Review your vaccination history and learn what vaccines you need Receive vaccines. Verify your eligibility for free and paid vaccines below.  Bring any vaccination records that you have to your appointment or ask your parent/guardian to scan, copy, or send you photos of the pages if you don't have them with you. Any information you can gather will help the nurse determine what you need. However, if you can't find your records, you can still have your vaccinations reviewed and updated, so don't hesitate to book your appointment! Vaccines available at Health Services Many vaccines are available at no cost to students, staff and faculty. Criteria may apply to get the vaccine for free (see table below).  Health Services nurses and doctors can provide a prescription for certain paid vaccines: Gardasil, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, HPV-9, Shingles, Flu, Pneumonia and Meningitis. If you don't meet the criteria to receive a vaccine for free, you can still purchase and have the vaccine administered in a variety of locations in Montreal. Call Info-Santé (8-1-1) or visit vaccines411.ca to find the vaccination location nearest you.   Vaccine; protects against Ages to receive Who can receive the vaccine for free Td (can be combined with other vaccines) Protects against Tetanus (T) and Diphtheria (d) Primary vaccination (during childhood) 50 years of age Booster as needed with high-risk injury: talk with a health professional Everyone aP (Pertussis) (combined with other vaccines) Protects against Pertussis (whooping cough) Primary vaccination (during childhood) In the third trimester of every pregnancy Everyone Polio (combined with other vaccines) Protects against Poliomyelitis (polio) Primary vaccination (during childhood) Booster based on certain travel criteria Everyone HA (individual or combined with other vaccines) Protects against Hepatitis A Series of 2 doses given 5 months apart if not received in elementary school People living with liver disease Men who have sex with men People who use illegal drugs People who use oral, inhaled or injected drugs in unsanitary conditions People who live in an endemic community HB (individual or combined with other vaccines) Protects against Hepatitis B Primary vaccination (during childhood) OR Series of 2-3 doses (depending on age) over the course of 6 months People who are sexually active People living with liver disease People who are immunocompromised Recipients of blood transfusions Men who have sex with men Injection drug use Living with someone who has Hepatitis B People in fields where there is a professional risk of being exposed to blood or blood products Influenza (Flu) vaccine Protects against influenza (Flu) 6 months and older, with emphasis to those at increased risk of complications from flu Available from November onward until stock depleted Consult Quebec’s flu vaccination program or Learn more about Health Services' annual Flu Vacine Campaign Pneumoccocal vaccines Protects against Pneumoccocal diseases One dose over 2 months old if health issue One dose to adults ≥65 years of age   Same as flu criteria, excluding asthma People who are immunocompromised: discuss with a health professional Varicella vaccine (individual or combined with MMR vaccine)  Protects against varicella (chickenpox) Primary vaccination (during childhood) OR 2 doses given 8 weeks apart for those who did not have chickenpox at ≥1 year old.

Locations include: Concordia University Health Services: Concordia Health Services nurses and doctors can provide a prescription for certain paid vaccines: Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, HPV-9, Shingles, Flu, Pneumonia and Meningitis. Call to book an appointment for more information. If there are no contraindications, you will be given a prescription. You will fill the prescription at the pharmacy and return to the clinic for your injection, depending on availability. Your local pharmacy: You will need to meet with a nurse at the pharmacy. Not all pharmacies provide nursing services, so call first or go in person to book an appointment. Pharmacies that offer vaccines include Jean Coutu (flu), Brunet, Pharmaprix, and Uniprix Note: Every pharmacy has different policies regarding requiring a prescription for vaccines, so call to find out if they require a doctor's prescription or if the pharmacy nurse can give you the vaccine without a doctor's prescription. No prescription needed at the Pharmaprix across the street from the EV building (1500 St. Catherine St. W.). Go to the pharmacist and book an appointment with the vaccine nurse. You will be able to receive the vaccine there, for the price of the vaccine + an injection fee. You can then submit your receipt to your insurance provider, if they cover vaccines. Note: Please verify with your insurance provider, as most do not need a doctor's prescription to reimburse vaccines. This can save yourself a doctor's appointment.

I have nothing but positive things to say and I do... not regret my choice. Whether it is the way I was welcomed, which was very well organized by Human Resources, meetings with my manager to find out how I am doing or the president who takes the time to explain the company’s situation to us in the most transparent way possible during this pandemic, there were several ways in which I was made to feel at home and a part of the team.

Google Ads allows you to target different types of locations, including postal codes, cities, regions and more. But, keep in mind that some target types aren't available in all countries. You can also choose to show your ads to people in places of interest, such as airports or universities. Location target types Take a look at the chart below to see examples of the location target types available for Google Ads: Target type Examples Airports Toronto Pearson International Airport John F. Kennedy International Airport Autonomous community Andalusia, Spain Valencia, Spain Borough Benito Juarez, Mexico Canton Bern, Switzerland Zurich, Switzerland City San Francisco, California Paris, France City region North East Suburbs, Australia Congressional district CA-12: 12th District of California AL-4: 4th District of Alabama Country Mexico Sweden County Claire, Ireland Nord-Trøndelag, Norway Vukovar-Syrmia, Croatia Department Loire, France Val-de-Marne, France Nielsen® DMA® (Designated Market Areas) regions Detroit, MI Cincinnati, OH Governorate Gharbia, Egypt Beheira, Egypt Municipality Burgas, Bulgaria Espoo, Finland Buccinasco, Italy Neighborhoods Billingham, UK Strand, UK Okrug Southern Administrative Okrug, Russia Admiralteysky District, Russia Postal code 76622, US RM17, UK Prefecture Aichi, Japan Fukuoka, Japan Province Navarre, Spain Mersin Province, Turkey Region Asti, Italy Busan, South Korea State Alaska, United States Uttar Pradesh, India Saarland, Germany Territory Northwest Territories, Canada Yukon, Canada TV region London, UK Midlands, UK Union territory Delhi, India Lakshadweep, India University Stanford University McGill University All available location targets To see the full list of available location targets in Google Ads, including specific countries, cities, regions and more, take a look at the Targets table in our Google Ads API (AdWords API) documentation. Here are a few tips for using the table: Filter by target type: Locate the dropdown menu above the “Target Type” heading. Choose the target type that you’d like to use to filter your table. For example, select City then hit Apply to view all cities that can be targeted in Google Ads. Filter by country code: Above the Country code heading, enter a country code to see all the location targets available within that country. You can also filter by target type. For example, enter “FR” as the country code and select City then hit Apply to view all targetable cities in France. Sort: Click any column header in the table to sort your results alphabetically by that column. For example, click Name to sort the names alphabetically in the table.

You can select whether you’d like your ad to appear for someone’s physical location, locations of interest, or both. Location targeting can help you make sure your ads are relevant to the people who see them—which can help boost your campaign's value. Where your users are located or regularly located (physical location) The Google Ads system uses a number of factors to determine someone’s physical location and whether to show your ad. When possible, we determine physical location based on someone's computer or mobile device location, or other methods. IP address: Location is typically based on the Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is a unique number assigned by Internet Service Providers to each computer connected to the Internet. If a device is connected to a Wi-Fi network, we may detect the Wi-Fi network's IP address to determine physical location. If a mobile device is connected to a mobile carrier's proxy server, we may use the carrier IP to determine the device's location. Device location: Depending on a user's location settings, we may be able to use a precise location for advertising, based on one of these sources of location data: GPS: Accuracy varies depending on GPS signal and connection. Wi-Fi: Accuracy should be similar to the access range of a typical Wi-Fi router. Bluetooth: If Bluetooth and/or Bluetooth scanning are enabled on a device, a publicly broadcast Bluetooth signal can provide an accurate indication of location Google's cell ID (cell tower) location database: Used in the absence of Wi-Fi or GPS. Accuracy is dependent on how many cell towers are located within an area and available data, and some devices don't support cell ID location. Locations your users have shown interest in (location of interest) If the Google Ads system detects geographic areas that someone has shown interest in, we may show appropriate ads targeted to that area or surrounding areas (known as ""location of interest""). Some of the ways that we might detect a location of interest are based on: Terms used in searches that indicate a location. Past searches that indicated a location of interest. A person’s past physical locations. The content and context of a website where an ad is displayed. Keep in mind that the mention of a location on a page doesn't always indicate an interest in that location. Searches on Google Maps or Google Maps for Mobile. If someone sets a custom location for Google search results. On the Google Display Network, we may infer a location associated with a page or site when we believe it will be useful for targeting your ads. A location mentioned on a page may not always indicate interest in that location. For example, someone who is reading news about San Francisco isn’t necessarily interested in ads for San Francisco florists. Similarly, we might infer an interest in a location, even if that location isn't specifically mentioned on a page, but the context of the entire site indicates an interest in that place. Location of interest isn't restricted to a person's country, or the Google search domain the person is searching on. For example, if someone in Paris, France searches for Los Angeles taxi on google.fr (France), we may still identify Los Angeles as a location they're interested in. Advanced location options The default advanced location option in Google Ads will use both physical location (where a user is located or is regularly located) and / or location of interest to determine where ads can appear. You can update your advanced location options at any time. Related areas When you target an area, we may also show your ad to customers in nearby, closely related areas that normally couldn't be targeted because of low population, insufficient data about the geographic area, or because that level of targeting isn't available. For example, if you target the city of Portland, we may also show your ads to people in nearby suburbs of Portland. Keep in mind Location targeting is based on a variety of signals, including users' settings, devices, and behavior on our platform, and is Google’s best effort to serve ads to users who meet your location settings. Because these signals vary, 100% accuracy is not guaranteed in every situation. As always, you should check your overall performance metrics to help ensure your settings are meeting your advertising goals and change them accordingly.

To calculate ROI, take the revenue that resulted from your ads and listings, subtract your overall costs, then divide by your overall costs: ROI = (Revenue - Cost of goods sold) / Cost of goods sold. Example Let's say you have a product that costs $100 to produce, and sells for $200. You sell 6 of these products as a result of advertising them on Google Ads. Your total sales are $1200, and your Google Ads costs are $200. Your ROI is ($1200-($600+$200))/($600+$200), or 50%. To help measure your Google Ads ROI, you'll need to track conversions, actions that you want your customers to take on your website after clicking your ad such as a purchase, sign-up, or download. Try conversion tracking or Google Analytics, free tools to help you track conversions in your account. ROI is typically the most important measurement for retailers because it shows the real effect that Google Ads has on your business. While it's helpful to know the number of clicks and impressions you get, it's even better to know how your ads and listings are contributing to the success of your business.

Keep in mind that when you submit a tracking URL for the ads redirect attribute, customers will be sent to that URL, rather than the URL you submit for the link [link] or mobile link [mobile_link] attributes. After parameter expansion, the domain of the ads redirect attribute needs to exactly match the domain of the link attribute (as well as the mobile link attribute, if present). This allows for parallel tracking, which sends people directly from your ad to your website and helps your landing page to load more quickly. If you want to use a third-party click measurement system, you can set the tracking template in Google Ads to specify a tracking server URL. IMPORTANT With the launch of parallel tracking, the domains of the link [link], mobile link [mobile_link] (if present), and ads redirect [ads_redirect] attributes are required to match. If the domains for these attributes are found to be different, you may lose tracking. Learn more about parallel tracking When to use Optional for each product Not available for products listed for free on Google If you need to track campaign metrics, you can do that by specifying additional landing page parameters on your product page. Learn more about how link, mobile link, and ads redirect attributes work together If your products are being advertised through a display campaign, use the link for display ads [display_ads_link] attribute instead. Through Google Ads, you can use a tracking template to add tracking parameters (to the URL that you submit) at the campaign, ad group, and product group levels. Learn more about how to add tracking templates Format Follow these formatting guidelines to make sure Google understands the data you're submitting. For details on when and how to submit values in English, learn more about submitting your product data Type URL (including http or https), ASCII characters only, and RFC 3986 compliant Limits 1–2000 characters Repeated field No File format Example value Text (TSV) https://tracking.example.com?product=ballpoint-pens XML (Feeds) <g:ads_redirect>https://tracking.example.com?product=ballpoint-pens</g:ads_redirect> To format your data for Content API, see the Content API for Shopping. Guidelines Follow these guidelines to make sure you submit high-quality data for your products. Minimum requirements These are the requirements you'll need to meet to show your product. If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in the Diagnostics page in your Merchant Center account. Redirect to a landing page that meets the landing page requirements. Learn about requirements for Shopping ads landing pages Redirect to the same landing page content submitted for the link or mobile link attribute. After customers visit your tracking page, redirect them to the same landing page content that you submitted for the link [link] or mobile link [mobile_link] attribute. Use the accepted ValueTrack parameters if your tracking URL contains parameters. Learn more about ValueTrack parameters Use a value that will resolve into a valid URL after any parameters or tracking templates are replaced with their final values. For example, the following value would not display as a valid URL for desktops: {ifmobile:ht}tp://example.com Best practices These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your product data for performance. Avoid using redirects. Redirects increase the time between a user clicking your ad and loading your landing page. Lengthy loading times cause a negative user experience. To track ad clicks, use the Google Ads tracking template. Include your mobile-specific landing page with tracking in this attribute. Use the {ifmobile} ValueTrack parameter (in the value that you submit for the ads redirect attribute) to redirect only mobile customers. For example: https://tracking.example.com?p=ballpoint-pens&m={ifmobile:true}{ifnotmobile:false} https://{ifmobile:m}{ifnotmobile:www}.example.com/product?id=123?param=abc Examples Note: All examples that feature the link [link] attribute also apply for the mobile link [mobile_link] attribute. Using Google Ads tracking templates If you intend to use Google Ads tracking templates, ads redirect [ads_redirect] attribute, with the appropriate values. Link [link] https://www.example.com/product?id=123 Ads redirect [ads_redirect] https://www.example.com/product?id=123&param=abc Google Ads tracking template https://tracking.com?url={lpurl}&src=google If a tracking template and ads redirect attribute are both used, the attribute value is used as {lpurl} in the Google Ads tracking template.

Substituting {lpurl} with a Google substitute URL ensures that your webpage doesn't get pinged twice (once from the user click, and again from the parallel tracking redirect).

You might not be able to use these attributes to thoroughly describe your variants if you sell build-to-order custom products or products that vary by other qualities. The best practices here provide tips for how to submit variants when your products don't fit the detailed product attributes Google provides. If you aren't familiar with the terms used here, learn more about detailed product attributes and variants. Best practices for submitting products that vary by unsupported variants Do not submit multiple iterations of the same product for each compatible third-party product. For example windshield wipers that are compatible with a variety of cars or phone cases that are compatible with a variety of phones. Instead list all of the product’s compatibilities in its product description. If you're selling different variants of a similar product, where each is considered a different product by design make sure to: Specify the difference in the title and description. Ensure that each product has a corresponding GTINs or other unique product identifier, which confirms its uniqueness. Example You sell auto parts, and each component you sell differs based on the make and model of the car that would use it. Since the Products Feed Specification doesn't have attributes for make and model, you can't submit variants with an item group ID [item_group_id] attribute. Instead, you should submit each unique product only once in your product data and specify the compatibility information, like the auto part's target make and model, in the description [description] attribute for each product. Note that a unique product is identified by having its own manufacturer part number [mpn] and a manufacturer-assigned brand [brand] or a valid GTIN [gtin] obtained from the manufacturer. Learn more about submitting compatible or refurbished third-party products Best practices for submitting custom products In your product data, submit either the complete configured product or the components for a product. If you submit a completely configured product, submit products that are readily available and best-sellers. If you submit a component of a product, make sure that the image, description, and price reflect the component you're selling. Learn more about requirements for customized products If your inventory and prices change frequently throughout the day, you might consider using automatic item updates. Example You're a custom jewelry manufacturer, and you allow customers on your website to select from setting and stone options to create the final product. You have so many possible combinations for your products that you don't want to set them all as variants with an item group ID [item_group_id] attribute in your product data. Instead, you decide to promote only your best selling configurations on Google. When a customer sees an ad for your jewelry, they see the price and image for the completely configured product.

You can use the provided reach numbers to get a rough idea of how many people your ads could reach within a geographic area. This article explains how ad reach is estimated and what happens when your location target can only reach a limited number of people. How it works With reach, you can estimate how many customers can see your ads in Michigan or Montana, or compare the number of people who might see your ad in Detroit and Ann Arbor. You can use those estimates to decide whether you've targeted the right areas, or if you need to select other areas that may provide the right level of exposure. You may find some locations have limited reach, which means that ads targeting these locations may have a more limited audience. Tip Reach estimates should only be used as general guidance for determining the relative number of users in a location target, as compared with other location targets. How it's estimated Reach in Google Ads is based on an estimate of the number of people seen on Google properties within the specified geographic area. Therefore, you may find that reach numbers in Google Ads may differ significantly from census population data or other sources due to a range of factors, including: Number of accounts used per person Number of temporary visitors to a geographic location Length of time each person spends on a website Number of signed-in people Search partner or Google Display Network visits which aren’t included in reach number estimates Tip Reach helps you estimate the total number of people you could potentially reach with your ads, but it won't be able to tell you the total number of impressions your ads could receive. Locations with limited reach For some locations, you may see a ""Limited reach"" warning in Google Ads. Limited reach means we aren't able to associate people with a selected geographic location by their Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Possible reasons include a low number of users in the location, or the quality of IP to location mapping.

Grant application submission process The Research Grants unit provides an administrative review of the grant application and will send the faculty member comments and suggestions via e-mail. Using the comments and suggestions, the faculty member will prepare the final version of the application and all necessary copies. The final should be submitted to the OOR at least three working days before the agency deadline, to ensure that the last signature and approval from the University can be obtained. The grant application is then submitted, either electronically or by courier, to the agency. ConRAD is an automated system for the management of research information that allows for the internal review and endorsement of applications of grants and the submission of compliance protocols. Researchers can submit and review documents through ConRAD.   Download the ConRAD checklist View the ConRAD Tutorial Apply for Grant Funding There are still two elements to a research application: Your proposal to the sponsor, and University approval to apply. Available Forms: Grant Details Form Inter-institutional Details Form Seed Funding, Team Grants, Facilities Optimization, and Aid to Research Related Events Programs Easy Steps Open ConRAD. (The link can also be found on Carrefour's My CU Account page.)  Under ""Apply New,"" open the necessary form about one week before the internal deadline. Complete the fields and attach the final version of your proposal. ConRAD automatically routes your request through the internal approval process, ending at the Office of Research (OOR). At the OOR, we can approve your application by: sending it to the sponsor via their online system, or signing the hardcopy, if the sponsor prefers a paper submission. When your proposal is ready for submission to the sponsor, follow the sponsor’s instructions: Sponsors using online systems: submit your final proposal through their system. The OOR will review and forward it to the sponsor. Paper Submissions: OOR will sign the application, and either you or an OOR employee can forward the hardcopy to the sponsor. Using ConRAD does not replace the need to submit your final proposal to the sponsor, but it is required for grant approvals. Submit a HREC protocol Available Forms: Human Research Ethics - Summary Protocol Form Easy Steps Open ConRAD. (You can also find this link on Carrefour's My CU Account page.) Under ""Apply New,"" open a Summary Protocol Form (SPF) prior to the start of the research project. Complete the fields and attach the required documents. ConRAD automatically routes your request through to the Office of Research (OOR). Important: It may take up to six weeks for the committee’s decision. Data collection should not begin until ethics approval has been obtained. ConRAD support Did you try checking the ConRAD FAQ for what you're looking for? You can also view the ConRAD Tutorial.

Some of Google's URLs include www.google.com, adwords.googleblog.com, and http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy. Just as buildings and houses have a street address, webpages also have unique addresses to help people locate them. On the Internet, these addresses are called URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). A webpage's URL—such as http://support.google.com/google-ads—is made up of a domain name (here it's ""google""), a domain category ("".com""), and sometimes other elements like a subdomain (""support"") and path (""/google-ads""). For each of your ads, you specify a display URL that's shown with your ad as well as a final URL that determines where people are taken when they click your ad. To find a webpage's URL, look in the address bar near the top of your Internet browser. Display URL policy How to edit your URLs Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit Need more help?

These tests served to verify the sound quality, accuracy of information and performance of the data transmission system. Transit users took part in these tests by texting us their comments. Here are a few: ""The display screen is brillant: I never worry about missing my stop."" ""It's a great idea to announce bus stops this way. It allows us to know where we are and it all looks quite futuristic."" ""I really appreciated the bus stop identification, both visual and audio, especially because it's a new bus route for me.""

The contract for this technology was signed in fall 2012 with the German firm INIT Innovations in Transportation (Eastern Canada) Inc. It covers the purchase and implementation of a passenger information and operational support system, including new radio infrastructure and radio equipment for the entire fleet of vehicles. Close Ouvrir la section: What is the difference between real time and planned time? Real time is made possible thanks to vehicle geolocation. By knowing the exact position of every bus on the road, it is possible to predict at what time the bus will really arrive at a bus stop and to communicate this information to customers in real time. This information is displayed in minutes and is available 20 minutes before the bus arrives at the stop (e.g. bus in 15 minutes). Real-time schedules are currently available through our website, mobile site, information terminals, some bus shelters, text messages and certain partner apps. Schedules updated daily take into consideration events or operational issues that may impact the network. You can check them on the day of your trip under Schedules and maps or from the Bus – Schedules section of the ""Our networks"" menu. Select the bus line and stop you want and choose ""day."" Planned schedules: Planned times are the times a bus will leave as planned. They are modified four times a year and are perfect to help you plan your trips several days in advance. This information is shown in hours on all customer information tools and schedules (e.g., 13:14). Available from these tools: Planibus and Schedules and maps when you choose a day other than the current one. Planned schedules are also available in the Bus – Schedules section of the ""Our networks"" menu. Choose the bus line and stop you want and select ""Week."" Note that planned schedules are used by the YOUR TRIP planning algorithm when suggesting travel options.

You can also do your part for air quality by taking simple actions.Monitoring emissions produced by factories Montréal has regulations that are in force all across the island of Montréal to reduce atmospheric emissions from the activities of thousands of manufacturing plants and factories. As well as regulating air quality, the city also monitors it through the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air (RSQA). The Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air The Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air has a team that measures, analyzes and validates the concentrations of pollutants in the surrounding air to provide a status of the stiuation. The network’s 11 stations (in French) are spread out across the island of Montréal. Tests conducted by the city Devices are continually testing the concentration of pollutants to calculate the air quality index. This index measures air quality and is updated every hour. The index has three colours: good (green), acceptable (yellow) or poor (red). The result is a clear indicator of the level of pollution in the air. This indicator is broadcast on all platforms of the Weather Network and on the screens of Montréal’s subway system. How can we do our part for air quality? You can help improve Montréal’s air quality by: Reducing your vehicle use as much as possible. Use active transportation (walking, biking, public transporation). Don’t run your car when not driving or moving slowly. For example, turn off your engine when you are parked. Obey the prohibition on wood heating during smog alerts. Did you know that wood heating is one of the main causes of wintertime smog in Montréal? It is prohibited to use a wood-burning stove or fireplace during smog warnings. This prohibition is in effect at all times if your appliance is not compliant with emission regulations. Smog alerts To get smog alerts on your phone, download the Weather Can mobile app. Alerts issued by Environment Canada are integrated into the app.Quick searchEnvironmentHealth and Public SafetyDid you find what you need?Help us make our site better.YesNoPlease explain what could be improved.SubmitCancelBack to topMy accountAbout my AccountCreate an AccountNotices and AlertsContact usAccess to information requestContact the CityReport a ProblemWork with usCall for BidsCity Vendors (in French)JobsVisiting MontréalCity HallMTLWiFiTourisme MontréalAbout usBy-lawsLogo and Visibility StandardsMediasNews ReleasesPublic NoticesFollow us Facebook LinkedIn Twitter YoutubeBoroughs BoroughsAhuntsic-Cartierville (in French)Anjou (in French)Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-GrâceL'Île-Bizard–Sainte-GenevièveLachineLaSalleLe Plateau-Mont-Royal (in French)Le Sud-Ouest (in French)Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve (in French)Montréal-Nord (in French)Outremont (in French)Pierrefonds-RoxboroRivière-des-Prairies–Pointe-aux-Trembles (in French)Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie (in French)Saint-LaurentSaint-Léonard (in French)VerdunVille-Marie (in French)Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension (in French)PrivacyLegal noticeFrançaisAre you sure you want to leave this page?This page is not available in English.

For products that are not exclusively for children, submit the age group attribute with the value set to adult. This will not limit the search results that your product can appear for, and it does not mean that your product contains sexually suggestive content. (If your product does contain sexually suggestive content, then use the adult [adult] attribute.) Submit this attribute if your product varies by age, even if it is not a variant. This will help ensure that your product is shown in search results that are filtered by age. Examples Products that vary by age group Many products vary by age, and adding an age group can help ensure that your products are shown with the right search results. For example, these types of products can vary by age group: Apparel Games Books Bed Sheets Blankets Duvet Covers Nap Mats Pillowcases & Shams Quilts & Comforters Towels Parasols & Rain Umbrellas Pool Toys Pool Floats & Loungers Night Lights & Ambient Lighting Piggy Banks & Money Jars Rugs Curtains & Drapes Throw Pillows Toys Sizes that vary by age group To show customers the correct size information, the age group attribute is also used together with the gender [gender] attribute.

The Premise Human activity is impacting our planet in a way that has pushed it to the edge of irreversible damage. LEADS aims to develop leaders who, by leveraging digital technology, can provide sustainable science-based solutions to the most critical challenges that currently threaten the stability of our climate and ecosystems The Program The digital revolution is offering scientists unprecedented opportunities to gather, analyze and communicate their findings faster – and to a much wider audience – than ever before. Through the power of advanced digital tools and techniques, the LEADS graduate training program will enable us to accelerate the pace towards ultimately achieving the Sustainable Development Goals set out by world leaders, as well as the climate goals of the Paris Agreement We will train a new generation of leaders to help solve global sustainability challenges. Damon Matthews, PhD, Training Program Leader Professor and Tier 1 Concordia University Research Chair (Climate Science and Sustainability) in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment in the Faculty of Arts and Science. The Curriculum Courses will be taught online and cover a wide array of topics ranging from social media strategy and digital tools to machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Thematic research components of the LEADS program will focus on such areas as: Scientific foundational work in support of climate mitigation goals Better communication strategies for more effective policy implementation  Trainees will also gain hands-on experience with opportunities to participate in internships with Future Earth to work on Canadian-led or international sustainability projects. Humanity today is interconnected through, and dependent on, both the digital and natural worlds, creating massive opportunities and equally large challenges. The next generation of leaders must be bilingual in both digital and sustainability issues. Amy Luers, PhD, Executive Director of Future Earth and Affiliate Professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment in the Faculty of Arts and Science. The Participants This program is open to graduate-level students and postdoctoral fellows who are interested in training to become scientific leaders in the global sustainability community. Potential student applicants must be enrolled either at Concordia University, McGill University, Université de Montréal, or Université du Québec à Montréal   The Outcome Successful participants will acquire through the LEADS program the unique skills, knowledge and experience necessary to: Inform major climate policies worldwide Influence research agendas towards achieving current sustainability goals Promote dialogue between like-minded research communities crucial for everything from interdisciplinary collaborations to policy communication  Want to know more about the LEADS initiative? This initiative is made possible by a $1.65 million grant from the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada’s (NSERC) Collaborative Research and Training Experience (CREATE) program and is being co-led by McGill University, Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), and Université de Montréal.

Use these filters for reporting and bidding on groups of products. The information you include in this attribute won’t be shown to customers. For example, you could label a group of products as seasonal, clearance, or selling rate. When to use Optional for each product If you advertise your products through Shopping campaigns in Google Ads, use custom labels to group products for reporting and bidding. The custom label attributes are numbered 0–4: Custom label 0 [custom_label_0] Custom label 1 [custom_label_1] Custom label 2 [custom_label_2] Custom label 3 [custom_label_3] Custom label 4 [custom_label_4] Format Follow these formatting guidelines to make sure Google understands the data you're submitting. For details on when and how to submit values in English, learn more about submitting your product data Type String (Unicode characters. Recommended: ASCII only), not case sensitive Limits 1–100 characters, up to 1,000 unique values account-wide for each custom label attribute (up to 5,000 labels total) Repeated field No, but you can create up to five custom labels numbered custom label 0 [custom_label_0] through custom label 4 [custom_label_4]   File format Example value Text (TSV) summer XML (Feeds) <g:custom_label_0>summer</g:custom_label_0> To format your data for Content API, see the Content API for Shopping. Guidelines Follow these guidelines to make sure you submit high-quality data for your products. Minimum requirements These are the requirements you'll need to meet to show your product. If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in the Diagnostics page in your Merchant Center account. Submit only 1 value for each custom label attribute. Create up to 1,000 unique labels for each custom label attribute across your account (up to 5,000 labels total, 1,000 labels per attribute). If you submit products with a custom label after you exceed the limit, those additional labels won't be taken into account for both reporting and bidding. Product group membership of products submitted with additional labels after the limit was exceeded will be evaluated as if the additional label wasn't set. To fix the issue, reduce the number of unique labels, and then resubmit your product data. Use the custom label attributes for Shopping campaigns only. For Display with dynamic remarketing campaigns, use the product grouping label for Display ads [ads_labels] and product grouping for Display ads [ads_grouping] attributes. Best practices These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your product data for performance. Create up to five custom labels for each product: custom_label_0 through custom_label_4 Choose your own definition for each of the five custom labels. Keep in mind the possible values for each label. You can add the values to each product in your Merchant Center account based on your definition. Use feed rules to assign custom labels automatically based on values you already submitted in your product data. For example, if you want a custom label to represent different price ranges, you could set a rule that automatically applies a certain value to custom_label_0 based on the price range. For example, you might use the following labels: 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20+. Learn more about feed rules Examples Custom label definitions Set up your own definitions for custom labels and include only one type of label per attribute. This definition isn’t something that you enter in Google Ads or Merchant Center, but it will help your own understanding of what values you should include. Attribute custom_label_0 Your definition Season Example values Winter, spring, summer, fall     Attribute custom_label_1 Your definition Selling rate Example values Best seller, low seller     Attribute custom_label_2 Your definition Price ranges Example values 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20+     Attribute custom_label_3 Your definition Margin Example values Low margin, high margin     Attribute custom_label_4 Your definition Release year Example values 1998, 2000, 2010, 2016 Example values For each product that you submit, you can include only one label (for example, “summer”) per attribute (for example, custom label 0 [custom_label_0]). However if you want to include multiple labels, add the other custom label attributes. Remember that each of these attributes is optional. So include a custom label only if it’s helpful to you.

Site search Concordia Directories Search School of Graduate Studies COTUTELLEGive your PhD a global perspective Did you know you can pursue doctoral research at more than one university? A cotutelle opens doors to international researchers and gives you a joint PhD.   A cotutelle refers to an agreement on joint supervision between two universities at the doctoral level. It allows the students to get a joint PhD degree delivered and recognized by both institutions. Full-time doctoral students can take advantage of an exceptional opportunity to earn a joint PhD degree while developing strong connections with international partners. Through the cotutelle program, PhD candidates work in collaboration with distinguished faculty members from Concordia and an international partner university to produce an original thesis. The program requires that students satisfy each institution's minimum requirements and submit their dissertation to both universities prior to graduation. Successful candidates receive a PhD degree from Concordia and the partner institution. Benefits of a cotutelle For the student Opportunities for international research Collaborations with other researchers A recognized joint degree from Concordia and the partner university  For the university Expansion of international relationships for Concordia Raises Concordia’s visibility abroad as a centre of cutting-edge research Provides supervisors and faculty members with opportunities to develop international collaborations Candidate FAQs Where can I do a cotutelle? You are eligible to register at any international accredited university that is open to a cotutelle agreement. Concordia supervisors must approve the partner university and agree to work in collaboration with the chosen co-supervisor. How can I apply as a Concordia student? Discuss the cotutelle plan with your current Concordia supervisor Contact Irene Grigoropoulos, graduate admission advisor at the School of Graduate Studies, to discuss a potential cotutelle before communicating with the partner university If approved, reach out to your potential co-supervisor at the partner university Follow the requirements needed to enrol at the partner university Complete a Cotutelle Agreement form with your supervisor, in collaboration with Irene Grigoropoulos All other required signatures will be collected by the School of Graduate Studies Once both universities approve the cotutelle program, you will be admitted Do I have to submit an admission application to the partner university? Yes, you must follow the partner university’s application/admission procedures. Do I have to pay tuition fees? You will pay tuition for the terms you are registered at Concordia University (a minimum of 3 non-consecutive terms are required). You need to contact the partner university for questions about their tuition fees. Do I have to start the cotutelle in the first term of my PhD? No. However, the cotutelle arrangement should be established as early as possible. Am I still eligible to receive funding if I hold a Federal or Provincial Granting Agency award? Yes, in most cases. It is best to contact the Graduate Awards Office to ensure that your particular award is eligible. Do I still receive my Concordia University internal scholarship when registered at the partner institution? Internal funding administered through the School of Graduate Studies will be honored when abroad. Students must seek approval for any internal awards administered through their department or Faculty while away on a cotutelle. Ready to begin?

Course delivery is in person, or a blend of in-person with online elements, with many student activities on campus, in accordance with Concordia's roadmap for a safe return. What happens if someone in my class tests positive for COVID-19? If someone in a class tests positive for COVID-19 and was on campus during the time they might have been contagious, everyone on the class list will be notified by email – regardless of whether they attended in person or not. The email will inform students of their contact risk level and provide instructions about what to do next. In most cases, because students must wear their procedure mask at all times, they will be considered a low-risk contact and will not need to self-isolate. They’ll simply need to monitor their health for symptoms. Because students may be in more than one class with the affected individual, they may receive more than one notification. Those who do not receive any email notifications are not considered to be at risk at this time. Anyone who develops symptoms should not come to campus. They must stay home and refer to Procedure for suspected or confirmed case What happens in the case of an individual who tests positive for COVID-19 at Concordia? Please note: Anyone who is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms should contact Quebec Public Health (1-877-644-4545) and follow their instructions. Concordians are also required to consult the Procedure for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases and complete the Self-Isolation form in the My Account section of the Student Hub (for students) or Carrefour (for faculty and staff). In the event of a positive case at the university, Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) will work with public health authorities to conduct an investigation and to trace possible contacts. EHS will directly contact any Concordian deemed to be a contact risk. In some instances, EHS may determine during their investigation that all attendees of a class need to self-isolate. Should this occur, EHS will advise the affected students’ departments and the Office of the Provost. The departments will then inform all the students’ professors and ensure that they make necessary arrangements. Where can I find the location of each Concordia building? Consult our campus maps. You can also access the maps via the Concordia app. Where can I go to study or to do my online class? Are there dedicated study rooms or spaces? Need a space to attend a remote class on campus? You are welcome to use the Library's non-silent study spaces. Learn more. You can also take advantage of new individual and group study spaces in the basement of the FB Building. Please note that the Grey Nuns Reading Room will remain closed for the fall term. For other options, please reach out to your faculty: The Faculty of Fine Arts may also have spaces for students to connect to remote courses while on campus. To find out if a space is available, please contact your department. Students in the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science can also contact Student Academic Services to ask if there are additional spaces available to connect to a remote course while on campus. Students in the John Molson School of Business currently registered in a course can book a study room in the MB Building. The Faculty of Arts and Science may also have spaces for students to connect to their remote courses while on campus. To find out if a space is available, please contact your department. Where can I eat on campus? Currently Buzz dining hall at Loyola and the Grey Nuns dining hall on the downtown campus are restricted to students who live in residence. See where you can grab a bite to eat or take a break if you brought your own snacks.  How can I find a place to live when I’m not in Montreal? You don’t need to wait to start looking into off-campus housing. We are hosting virtual online info sessions that you can attend now, to get oriented on how best to go about looking for a place once you arrive. Additional off-campus housing resources: Concordia Student Union’s Housing and Job Resource Centre General information about renting in Montreal Concordia has partnered with Places4students to offer you some off-campus housing options, as well as additional resources and information. The Woodnote housing co-op, a housing initiative designed by and for students Free classifieds such as Kijiji and Facebook Marketplace have listings for short- and long-term rentals all over Montreal What cleaning measures are in place on campus? Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) and Facilities Management have developed cleaning protocols. At this time, the university can confirm that classrooms will go through a full evening cleaning five times per week. Remote learning What technology can I access from home? You can access Moodle, Office 365 and Zoom from your mobile device. Follow these instructions to install Office 365 on your device. Follow these instructions to access Moodle from your mobile device. You can access Zoom by clicking on a Zoom meeting link, which will prompt you to download the Zoom app. (You can also download the app anytime via the app store for your device.) Many students with disabilities agree that online learning has been beneficial. Will Concordia continue giving these students online options? As part of the university’s consultations on teaching and learning, Concordia is refining the permanent place of its online learning offerings because it sees the benefits of this mode of delivery for all students. We will continue to offer some online courses. Ahead of each upcoming term, Concordia will provide information on which courses will be online, in person or “blended” — a mix of both — so students can make informed choices. Course offering decisions will be based on pedagogical needs. What if the in-person course I need — but cannot get access to — is mandatory for my degree, for example, a science lab, or only offered once a year? We recommend that you contact your program advisor for questions about course options and your course sequence. Some options may include taking the course in question at a later date or taking the entire term off. If you are a new student, you may also wish to consider deferring your admission to a later term. International students: Your choices may impact your immigration status, funding or eligibility to certain programs. If you have concerns, please contact the International Students Office. I’m located in Canada but don’t feel safe coming on campus. Can’t I take all online courses? The Government of Quebec announced that public health guidelines will allow for a safe return to an in-person university experience this fall, and students are expected to be on campus. Some of your courses may be online, on campus or a blend of both — that is, on campus with some online components. We have worked hard to create a safe and engaging environment with lots of in-person activities. Libraries, research labs and student residences have reopened. Some events and services, like Orientation, happen virtually, complemented by in-person components. I don’t have what I need to undertake the work assigned. Can the university help? Students can find resources on the Learn, teach, work from home page. How can I reach my academic advisor? Academic advisors and department staff are working remotely to help new and returning students. Concordia will post an announcement once public health guidelines allow in-person meetings. Learn more. Academics Is PASS being offered this year? At the height of the pandemic, the university allowed students to choose a PASS notation rather than a letter grade for one course per term. Since it was conceived of as an emergency, short-term measure, the PASS notation option will not be offered in the 2021-2022 academic year. Can I withdraw from a course after the fall DISC deadline? On an exceptional basis, the university is granting students permission to retroactively drop, or late DISC, one or more fall 2021 courses. The deadline to late DISC fall 2021 courses is Tuesday, December 7, 2021 at 11:59 p.m.  How to late DISC a course:  Go to My CU Account in the Student Hub  Under the Academic tab, click the Add/drop courses tile to proceed Confirm your transaction and/or verify your student record to ensure that the course was in fact properly dropped Please refer to the academic calendar for all rules and regulations pertaining to course withdrawals.  Undergraduate calendar Graduate calendar When is the DISC deadline for winter 2022?

Undergraduate studies The annual assessment of academic standing will resume this academic year in May 2022. Students in conditional or failed standing will receive an email at the end of May which will include their official academic standing, information on what steps need to be completed, and how to benefit from advising and other support services in order to back on track going forward. Learn more about academic standing. Graduate studies The academic progress of graduate students is assessed at the end of every term. To be considered in good standing, students in doctoral programs must maintain the F Rule, C Rule and an Assessment Grade Point Average (AGPA) of at least 3.00 based on a minimum of 12 credits. Students in master's, graduate diploma and graduate certificate programs must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.70. Independent and Visiting students are only subject to the F Rule. Learn more.  I was in conditional standing before the pandemic. What will happen if I am in conditional standing again in May 2022? Undergraduate students Conditional standing results when you have attempted at least 12 credits in the academic year and obtained an AGPA of less than 2.00, but at least 1.50. Normally, two consecutive conditional standing assessments result in a failed standing, meaning the university will withdraw you from your program for a year, though you may apply for readmission if there were extenuating circumstances that led to the failed standing.  However, due to the exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will not take your previous standing into account as part of the annual assessment of academic standing in May 2022.  An AGPA of less than 2.00, but at least 1.50 will therefore put you conditional standing in the May 2022 assessment.  Questions or concerns? Reach out to your advisor. I was in failed standing before the pandemic. I was then readmitted and I have continued to take courses since the last assessment. What will happen if I am in conditional standing or failed standing again in May 2022? Undergraduate students Failed standing results when you have attempted at least 12 credits in the academic year and obtained an AGPA of less than 1.50, or conditional standing in two consecutive periods of assessment. Normally, two consecutive failed standing assessments or a failed standing and a conditional standing assessment means in second time failed standing, resulting in the university withdrawing you from your program for two years.  However, due to the exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, your previous standing will not be taken into account, nor will it count towards the May 2022 annual assessments of academic standing. As a result, if you were in failed standing prior to the pandemic and you obtained a second failed standing or a conditional standing in May 2022, you will not go into  failed standing for a second time.  An AGPA of less than 1.50 will therefore result in first time failed standing in the May 2022 assessment. Questions or concerns? Reach out to your advisor. What is Moodle and how does it work? Moodle is a course management system you can access through your Student Centre or on your mobile device or computer. A step-by-step workflow from Centre for Teaching and Learning will show you how. What is Zoom-bombing and how could it affect my classes? Zoom-bombing is a term for the interruption of a live video call by an intruder, who disrupts the meeting or class with irrelevant or offensive material. PLEASE NOTE: You should never share a Zoom class ID. You should also know that Zoom-bombing a class could lead to a complaint under Concordia’s Code of Rights and Responsibilities. Concordia has adjusted default settings on our Zoom license to help lower the risk and offer students additional privacy.

To file a complaint about a Concordia community member’s behaviour, please contact the Office of Rights and Responsibilities. What is an eConcordia course? eConcordia offers online courses all the time. Students who take eConcordia courses must ALSO have an eConcordia account. Learn more. Non-eConcordia online courses are courses normally offered during the year that are being adapted for remote delivery due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation. Both eConcordia and non-eConcordia courses are for credit. How to tell which is which: On the class schedule, courses starting with “EC” in the “Section” column (after you obtain search results in the class schedule) are offered through eConcordia. See also: Academic advising FAQ for prospective and newly admitted undergraduate students FAQ relating to graduate and postdoctoral studies Information for international students Contacts Exams Will exams be in person or online? Our guideline is that the format of the exams is the same as the delivery format of the course: If a class is in-person, the exam should also be in person; if a class is online, the exam should be online.   If a class is both online and in person, the format of the exam may be in person or online. That information will be included in the syllabus at the start of term — so students will know what to expect. Are online exams proctored (supervised)? There are three possibilities for online exams: Some exams will not be proctored. Some exams will be proctored using a recording software. Some exams will be proctored using Zoom. Your course syllabus will explain whether and how your exam(s) will be proctored. If your exam is proctored, your syllabus will provide the details regarding the technical requirements and the possibility of the exam being recorded. Can I opt out of being recorded during an exam? If your course is using recording software, you may not opt out of being recorded during the exam. Your course syllabus provides the necessary details to allow you to make an informed choice whether to drop the class before the DNE deadline. Can I choose another form of exam supervision (like Zoom)? No, students may not choose the type of proctoring for each class. You will learn of the exam conditions from your syllabus, and you can consult an academic advisor to adjust your course registrations if you are not comfortable with the assessment method used.

113,Project Zero:  How a simple Linux kernel memory corruption bug can lead to complete system compromise,1,"Project Zero: How a simple Linux kernel memory corruption bug can lead to complete system compromise Project Zero News and updates from the Project Zero team at Google Tuesday, October 19, 2021 How a simple Linux kernel memory corruption bug can lead to complete system compromise An analysis of current and potential kernel security mitigations Posted by Jann Horn, Project Zero Introduction This blog post describes a straightforward Linux kernel locking bug and how I exploited it against Debian Buster's 4.19.0-13-amd64 kernel. Based on that, it explores options for security mitigations that could prevent or hinder exploitation of issues similar to this one. I hope that stepping through such an exploit and sharing this compiled knowledge with the wider security community can help with reasoning about the relative utility of various mitigation approaches. A lot of the individual exploitation techniques and mitigation options that I am describing here aren't novel. However, I believe that there is value in writing them up together to show how various mitigations interact with a fairly normal use-after-free exploit. Our bugtracker entry for this bug, along with the proof of concept, is at https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2125. Code snippets in this blog post that are relevant to the exploit are taken from the upstream 4.19.160 release, since that is what the targeted Debian kernel is based on; some other code snippets are from mainline Linux. (In case you're wondering why the bug and the targeted Debian kernel are from end of last year: I already wrote most of this blogpost around April, but only recently finished it) I would like to thank Ryan Hileman for a discussion we had a while back about how static analysis might fit into static prevention of security bugs (but note that Ryan hasn't reviewed this post and doesn't necessarily agree with any of my opinions). I also want to thank Kees Cook for providing feedback on an earlier version of this post (again, without implying that he necessarily agrees with everything), and my Project Zero colleagues for reviewing this post and frequent discussions about exploit mitigations. Background for the bug On Linux, terminal devices (such as a serial console or a virtual console) are represented by a struct tty_struct. Among other things, this structure contains fields used for the job control features of terminals, which are usually modified using a set of ioctls: struct tty_struct { [...] spinlock_t ctrl_lock; [...] struct pid *pgrp; /* Protected by ctrl lock */ struct pid *session; [...] struct tty_struct *link; [...] }[...]; The pgrp field points to the foreground process group of the terminal (normally modified from userspace via the TIOCSPGRP ioctl); the session field points to the session associated with the terminal. Both of these fields do not point directly to a process/task, but rather to a struct pid. struct pid ties a specific incarnation of a numeric ID to a set of processes that use that ID as their PID (also known in userspace as TID), TGID (also known in userspace as PID), PGID, or SID. You can kind of think of it as a weak reference to a process, although that's not entirely accurate. (There's some extra nuance around struct pid when execve() is called by a non-leader thread, but that's irrelevant here.) All processes that are running inside a terminal and are subject to its job control refer to that terminal as their ""controlling terminal"" (stored in ->signal->tty of the process). A special type of terminal device are pseudoterminals, which are used when you, for example, open a terminal application in a graphical environment or connect to a remote machine via SSH. While other terminal devices are connected to some sort of hardware, both ends of a pseudoterminal are controlled by userspace, and pseudoterminals can be freely created by (unprivileged) userspace. Every time /dev/ptmx (short for ""pseudoterminal multiplexor"") is opened, the resulting file descriptor represents the device side (referred to in documentation and kernel sources as ""the pseudoterminal master"") of a new pseudoterminal . You can read from it to get the data that should be printed on the emulated screen, and write to it to emulate keyboard inputs. The corresponding terminal device (to which you'd usually connect a shell) is automatically created by the kernel under /dev/pts/<number>. One thing that makes pseudoterminals particularly strange is that both ends of the pseudoterminal have their own struct tty_struct, which point to each other using the link member, even though the device side of the pseudoterminal does not have terminal features like job control - so many of its members are unused. Many of the ioctls for terminal management can be used on both ends of the pseudoterminal; but no matter on which end you call them, they affect the same state, sometimes with minor differences in behavior. For example, in the ioctl handler for TIOCGPGRP: /** * tiocgpgrp - get process group * @tty: tty passed by user * @real_tty: tty side of the tty passed by the user if a pty else the tty * @p: returned pid * * Obtain the process group of the tty. If there is no process group * return an error. * * Locking: none. Reference to current->signal->tty is safe. */ static int tiocgpgrp(struct tty_struct *tty, struct tty_struct *real_tty, pid_t __user *p) { struct pid *pid; int ret; /* * (tty == real_tty) is a cheap way of * testing if the tty is NOT a master pty. */ if (tty == real_tty && current->signal->tty != real_tty) return -ENOTTY; pid = tty_get_pgrp(real_tty); ret = put_user(pid_vnr(pid), p); put_pid(pid); return ret; } As documented in the comment above, these handlers receive a pointer real_tty that points to the normal terminal device; an additional pointer tty is passed in that can be used to figure out on which end of the terminal the ioctl was originally called. As this example illustrates, the tty pointer is normally only used for things like pointer comparisons. In this case, it is used to prevent TIOCGPGRP from working when called on the terminal side by a process which does not have this terminal as its controlling terminal. Note: If you want to know more about how terminals and job control are intended to work, the book ""The Linux Programming Interface"" provides a nice introduction to how these older parts of the userspace API are supposed to work. It doesn't describe any of the kernel internals though, since it's written as a reference for userspace programming. And it's from 2010, so it doesn't have anything in it about new APIs that have showed up over the last decade. The bug The bug was in the ioctl handler tiocspgrp: /** * tiocspgrp - attempt to set process group * @tty: tty passed by user * @real_tty: tty side device matching tty passed by user * @p: pid pointer * * Set the process group of the tty to the session passed. Only * permitted where the tty session is our session. * * Locking: RCU, ctrl lock */ static int tiocspgrp(struct tty_struct *tty, struct tty_struct *real_tty, pid_t __user *p) { struct pid *pgrp; pid_t pgrp_nr; [...] if (get_user(pgrp_nr, p)) return -EFAULT; [...] pgrp = find_vpid(pgrp_nr); [...] spin_lock_irq(&tty->ctrl_lock); put_pid(real_tty->pgrp); real_tty->pgrp = get_pid(pgrp); spin_unlock_irq(&tty->ctrl_lock); [...] } The pgrp member of the terminal side (real_tty) is being modified, and the reference counts of the old and new process group are adjusted accordingly using put_pid and get_pid; but the lock is taken on tty, which can be either end of the pseudoterminal pair, depending on which file descriptor we pass to ioctl(). So by simultaneously calling the TIOCSPGRP ioctl on both sides of the pseudoterminal, we can cause data races between concurrent accesses to the pgrp member. This can cause reference counts to become skewed through the following races: ioctl(fd1, TIOCSPGRP, pid_A) ioctl(fd2, TIOCSPGRP, pid_B) spin_lock_irq(...) spin_lock_irq(...) put_pid(old_pid) put_pid(old_pid) real_tty->pgrp = get_pid(A) real_tty->pgrp = get_pid(B) spin_unlock_irq(...) spin_unlock_irq(...) ioctl(fd1, TIOCSPGRP, pid_A) ioctl(fd2, TIOCSPGRP, pid_B) spin_lock_irq(...) spin_lock_irq(...) put_pid(old_pid) put_pid(old_pid) real_tty->pgrp = get_pid(B) real_tty->pgrp = get_pid(A) spin_unlock_irq(...) spin_unlock_irq(...) In both cases, the refcount of the old struct pid is decremented by 1 too much, and either A's or B's is incremented by 1 too much. Once you understand the issue, the fix seems relatively obvious: if (session_of_pgrp(pgrp) != task_session(current)) goto out_unlock; retval = 0; - spin_lock_irq(&tty->ctrl_lock); + spin_lock_irq(&real_tty->ctrl_lock); put_pid(real_tty->pgrp); real_tty->pgrp = get_pid(pgrp); - spin_unlock_irq(&tty->ctrl_lock); + spin_unlock_irq(&real_tty->ctrl_lock); out_unlock: rcu_read_unlock(); return retval; Attack stages In this section, I will first walk through how my exploit works; afterwards I will discuss different defensive techniques that target these attack stages. Attack stage: Freeing the object with multiple dangling references This bug allows us to probabilistically skew the refcount of a struct pid down, depending on which way the race happens: We can run colliding TIOCSPGRP calls from two threads repeatedly, and from time to time that will mess up the refcount. But we don't immediately know how many times the refcount skew has actually happened. What we'd really want as an attacker is a way to skew the refcount deterministically. We'll have to somehow compensate for our lack of information about whether the refcount was skewed successfully. We could try to somehow make the race deterministic (seems difficult), or after each attempt to skew the refcount assume that the race worked and run the rest of the exploit (since if we didn't skew the refcount, the initial memory corruption is gone, and nothing bad will happen), or we can attempt to find an information leak that lets us figure out the state of the reference count. On typical desktop/server distributions, the following approach works (unreliably, depending on RAM size) for setting up a freed struct pid with multiple dangling references: Allocate a new struct pid (by creating a new task). Create a large number of references to it (by sending messages with SCM_CREDENTIALS to unix domain sockets, and leaving those messages queued up). Repeatedly trigger the TIOCSPGRP race to skew the reference count downwards, with the number of attempts chosen such that we expect that the resulting refcount skew is bigger than the number of references we need for the rest of our attack, but smaller than the number of extra references we created. Let the task owning the pid exit and die, and wait for RCU (read-copy-update, a mechanism that involves delaying the freeing of some objects) to settle such that the task's reference to the pid is gone. (Waiting for an RCU grace period from userspace is not a primitive that is intentionally exposed through the UAPI, but there are various ways userspace can do it - e.g. by testing when a released BPF program's memory is subtracted from memory accounting, or by abusing the membarrier(MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL, ...) syscall after the kernel version where RCU flavors were unified.) Create a new thread, and let that thread attempt to drop all the references we created. Because the refcount is smaller at the start of step 5 than the number of references we are about to drop, the pid will be freed at some point during step 5; the next attempt to drop a reference will cause a use-after-free: struct upid { int nr; struct pid_namespace *ns; }; struct pid { atomic_t count; unsigned int level; /* lists of tasks that use this pid */ struct hlist_head tasks[PIDTYPE_MAX]; struct rcu_head rcu; struct upid numbers[1]; }; [...] void put_pid(struct pid *pid) { struct pid_namespace *ns; if (!pid) return; ns = pid->numbers[pid->level].ns; if ((atomic_read(&pid->count) == 1) || atomic_dec_and_test(&pid->count)) { kmem_cache_free(ns->pid_cachep, pid); put_pid_ns(ns); } } When the object is freed, the SLUB allocator normally replaces the first 8 bytes (sidenote: a different position is chosen starting in 5.7, see Kees' blog) of the freed object with an XOR-obfuscated freelist pointer; therefore, the count and level fields are now effectively random garbage. This means that the load from pid->numbers[pid->level] will now be at some random offset from the pid, in the range from zero to 64 GiB. As long as the machine doesn't have tons of RAM, this will likely cause a kernel segmentation fault. (Yes, I know, that's an absolutely gross and unreliable way to exploit this. It mostly works though, and I only noticed this issue when I already had the whole thing written, so I didn't really want to go back and change it... plus, did I mention that it mostly works?) Linux in its default configuration, and the configuration shipped by most general-purpose distributions, attempts to fix up unexpected kernel page faults and other types of ""oopses"" by killing only the crashing thread. Therefore, this kernel page fault is actually useful for us as a signal: Once the thread has died, we know that the object has been freed, and can continue with the rest of the exploit. If this code looked a bit differently and we were actually reaching a double-free, the SLUB allocator would also detect that and trigger a kernel oops (see set_freepointer() for the CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED case). Discarded attack idea: Directly exploiting the UAF at the SLUB level On the Debian kernel I was looking at, a struct pid in the initial namespace is allocated from the same kmem_cache as struct seq_file and struct epitem - these three slabs have been merged into one by find_mergeable() to reduce memory fragmentation, since their object sizes, alignment requirements, and flags match: root@deb10:/sys/kernel/slab# ls -l pid lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Feb 6 00:09 pid -> :A-0000128 root@deb10:/sys/kernel/slab# ls -l | grep :A-0000128 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Feb 6 00:09 :A-0000128 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Feb 6 00:09 eventpoll_epi -> :A-0000128 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Feb 6 00:09 pid -> :A-0000128 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Feb 6 00:09 seq_file -> :A-0000128 root@deb10:/sys/kernel/slab# A straightforward way to exploit a dangling reference to a SLUB object is to reallocate the object through the same kmem_cache it came from, without ever letting the page reach the page allocator. To figure out whether it's easy to exploit this bug this way, I made a table listing which fields appear at each offset in these three data structures (using pahole -E --hex -C <typename> <path to vmlinux debug info>): offset pid eventpoll_epi / epitem (RCU-freed) seq_file 0x00 count.counter (4) (CONTROL) rbn.__rb_parent_color (8) (TARGET?) buf (8) (TARGET?) 0x04 level (4) 0x08 tasks[PIDTYPE_PID] (8) rbn.rb_right (8) / rcu.func (8) size (8) 0x10 tasks[PIDTYPE_TGID] (8) rbn.rb_left (8) from (8) 0x18 tasks[PIDTYPE_PGID] (8) rdllink.next (8) count (8) 0x20 tasks[PIDTYPE_SID] (8) rdllink.prev (8) pad_until (8) 0x28 rcu.next (8) next (8) index (8) 0x30 rcu.func (8) ffd.file (8) read_pos (8) 0x38 numbers[0].nr (4) ffd.fd (4) version (8) 0x3c [hole] (4) nwait (4) 0x40 numbers[0].ns (8) pwqlist.next (8) lock (0x20): counter (8) 0x48 --- pwqlist.prev (8) 0x50 --- ep (8) 0x58 --- fllink.next (8) 0x60 --- fllink.prev (8) op (8) 0x68 --- ws (8) poll_event (4) 0x6c --- [hole] (4) 0x70 --- event.events (4) file (8) 0x74 --- event.data (8) (CONTROL) 0x78 --- private (8) (TARGET?) 0x7c --- --- 0x80 --- --- --- In this case, reallocating the object as one of those three types didn't seem to me like a nice way forward (although it should be possible to exploit this somehow with some effort, e.g. by using count.counter to corrupt the buf field of seq_file). Also, some systems might be using the slab_nomerge kernel command line flag, which disables this merging behavior. Another approach that I didn't look into here would have been to try to corrupt the obfuscated SLUB freelist pointer (obfuscation is implemented in freelist_ptr()); but since that stores the pointer in big-endian, count.counter would only effectively let us corrupt the more significant half of the pointer, which would probably be a pain to exploit. Attack stage: Freeing the object's page to the page allocator This section will refer to some internals of the SLUB allocator; if you aren't familiar with those, you may want to at least look at slides 2-4 and 13-14 of Christoph Lameter's slab allocator overview talk from 2014. (Note that that talk covers three different allocators; the SLUB allocator is what most systems use nowadays.) The alternative to exploiting the UAF at the SLUB allocator level is to flush the page out to the page allocator (also called the buddy allocator), which is the last level of dynamic memory allocation on Linux (once the system is far enough into the boot process that the memblock allocator is no longer used). From there, the page can theoretically end up in pretty much any context. We can flush the page out to the page allocator with the following steps: Instruct the kernel to pin our task to a single CPU. Both SLUB and the page allocator use per-cpu structures; so if the kernel migrates us to a different CPU in the middle, we would fail. Before allocating the victim struct pid whose refcount will be corrupted, allocate a large number of objects to drain partially-free slab pages of all their unallocated objects. If the victim object (which will be allocated in step 5 below) landed in a page that is already partially used at this point, we wouldn't be able to free that page. Allocate around objs_per_slab * (1+cpu_partial) objects - in other words, a set of objects that completely fill at least cpu_partial pages, where cpu_partial is the maximum length of the ""percpu partial list"". Those newly allocated pages that are completely filled with objects are not referenced by SLUB's freelists at this point because SLUB only tracks pages with free objects on its freelists. Fill objs_per_slab-1 more objects, such that at the end of this step, the ""CPU slab"" (the page from which allocations will be served first) will not contain anything other than free space and fresh allocations (created in this step). Allocate the victim object (a struct pid). The victim page (the page from which the victim object came) will usually be the CPU slab from step 4, but if step 4 completely filled the CPU slab, the victim page might also be a new, freshly allocated CPU slab. Trigger the bug on the victim object to create an uncounted reference, and free the object. Allocate objs_per_slab+1 more objects. After this, the victim page will be completely filled with allocations from steps 4 and 7, and it won't be the CPU slab anymore (because the last allocation can not have fit into the victim page). Free all allocations from steps 4 and 7. This causes the victim page to become empty, but does not free the page; the victim page is placed on the percpu partial list once a single object from that page has been freed, and then stays on that list. Free one object per page from the allocations from step 3. This adds all these pages to the percpu partial list until it reaches the limit cpu_partial, at which point it will be flushed: Pages containing some in-use objects are placed on SLUB's per-NUMA-node partial list, and pages that are completely empty are freed back to the page allocator. (We don't free all allocations from step 3 because we only want the victim page to be freed to the page allocator.) Note that this step requires that every objs_per_slab-th object the allocator gave us in step 3 is on a different page. When the page is given to the page allocator, we benefit from the page being order-0 (4 KiB, native page size): For order-0 pages, the page allocator has special freelists, one per CPU+zone+migratetype combination. Pages on these freelists are not normally accessed from other CPUs, and they don't immediately get combined with adjacent free pages to form higher-order free pages. At this point we are able to perform use-after-free accesses to some offset inside the free victim page, using codepaths that interpret part of the victim page as a struct pid. Note that at this point, we still don't know exactly at which offset inside the victim page the victim object is located. Attack stage: Reallocating the victim page as a pagetable At the point where the victim page has reached the page allocator's freelist, it's essentially game over - at this point, the page can be reused as anything in the system, giving us a broad range of options for exploitation. In my opinion, most defences that act after we've reached this point are fairly unreliable. One type of allocation that is directly served from the page allocator and has nice properties for exploitation are page tables (which have also been used to exploit Rowhammer). One way to abuse the ability to modify a page table would be to enable the read/write bit in a page table entry (PTE) that maps a file page to which we are only supposed to have read access - for example, this could be used to gain write access to part of a setuid binary's .text segment and overwrite it with malicious code. We don't know at which offset inside the victim page the victim object is located; but since a page table is effectively an array of 8-byte-aligned elements of size 8 and the victim object's alignment is a multiple of that, as long as we spray all elements of the victim array, we don't need to know the victim object's offset. To allocate a page table full of PTEs mapping the same file page, we have to: prepare by setting up a 2MiB-aligned memory region (because each last-level page table describes 2MiB of virtual memory) containing single-page mmap() mappings of the same file page (meaning each mapping corresponds to one PTE); then trigger allocation of the page table and fill it with PTEs by reading from each mapping struct pid has the same alignment as a PTE, and it starts with a 32-bit refcount, so that refcount is guaranteed to overlap the first half of a PTE, which is 64-bit. Because X86 CPUs are little-endian, incrementing the refcount field in the freed struct pid increments the least significant half of the PTE - so it effectively increments the PTE. (Except for the edge case where the least significant half is 0xffffffff, but that's not the case here.) struct pid: count | level | tasks[0] | tasks[1] | tasks[2] | ... pagetable: PTE | PTE | PTE | PTE | ... Therefore we can increment one of the PTEs by repeatedly triggering get_pid(), which tries to increment the refcount of the freed object. This can be turned into the ability to write to the file page as follows: Increment the PTE by 0x42 to set the Read/Write bit and the Dirty bit. (If we didn't set the Dirty bit, the CPU would do it by itself when we write to the corresponding virtual address, so we could also just increment by 0x2 here.) For each mapping, attempt to overwrite its contents with malicious data and ignore page faults. This might throw spurious errors because of outdated TLB entries, but taking a page fault will automatically evict such TLB entries, so if we just attempt the write twice, this can't happen on the second write (modulo CPU migration, as mentioned above). One easy way to ignore page faults is to let the kernel perform the memory write using pread(), which will return -EFAULT on fault. If the kernel notices the Dirty bit later on, that might trigger writeback, which could crash the kernel if the mapping isn't set up for writing. Therefore, we have to reset the Dirty bit. We can't reliably decrement the PTE because put_pid() inefficiently accesses pid->numbers[pid->level] even when the refcount isn't dropping to zero, but we can increment it by an additional 0x80-0x42=0x3e, which means the final value of the PTE, compared to the initial value, will just have the additional bit 0x80 set, which the kernel ignores. Afterwards, we launch the setuid executable (which, in the version in the pagecache, now contains the code we injected), and gain root privileges: user@deb10:~/tiocspgrp$ make as -o rootshell.o rootshell.S ld -o rootshell rootshell.o --nmagic gcc -Wall -o poc poc.c user@deb10:~/tiocspgrp$ ./poc starting up... executing in first level child process, setting up session and PTY pair... setting up unix sockets for ucreds spam... draining pcpu and node partial pages preparing for flushing pcpu partial pages launching child process child is 1448 ucreds spam done, struct pid refcount should be lifted. starting to skew refcount... refcount should now be skewed, child exiting child exited cleanly waiting for RCU call... bpf load with rlim 0x0: -1 (Operation not permitted) bpf load with rlim 0x1000: 452 (Success) bpf load success with rlim 0x1000: got fd 452 ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Defence This section describes different ways in which this exploit could perhaps have been prevented from working. To assist the reader, the titles of some of the subsections refer back to specific exploit stages from the section above. Against bugs being reachable: Attack surface reduction A potential first line of defense against many kernel security issues is to only make kernel subsystems available to code that needs access to them. If an attacker does not have direct access to a vulnerable subsystem and doesn't have sufficient influence over a system component with access to make it trigger the issue, the issue is effectively unexploitable from the attacker's security context. Pseudoterminals are (more or less) only necessary for interactively serving users who have shell access (or something resembling that), including: terminal emulators inside graphical user sessions SSH servers screen sessions started from various types of terminals Things like webservers or phone apps won't normally need access to such devices; but there are exceptions. For example: a web server is used to provide a remote root shell for system administration a phone app's purpose is to make a shell available to the user a shell script uses expect to interact with a binary that requires a terminal for input/output In my opinion, the biggest limits on attack surface reduction as a defensive strategy are: It exposes a workaround to an implementation concern of the kernel (potential memory safety issues) in user-facing API, which can lead to compatibility issues and maintenance overhead - for example, from a security standpoint, I think it might be a good idea to require phone apps and systemd services to declare their intention to use the PTY subsystem at install time, but that would be an API change requiring some sort of action from application authors, creating friction that wouldn't be necessary if we were confident that the kernel is working properly. This might get especially messy in the case of software that invokes external binaries depending on configuration, e.g. a web server that needs PTY access when it is used for server administration. (This is somewhat less complicated when a benign-but-potentially-exploitable application actively applies restrictions to itself; but not every application author is necessarily willing to design a fine-grained sandbox for their code, and even then, there may be compatibility issues caused by libraries outside the application author's control.) It can't protect a subsystem from a context that fundamentally needs access to it. (E.g. Android's /dev/binder is directly accessible by Chrome renderers on Android because they have Android code running inside them.) It means that decisions that ought to not influence the security of a system (making an API that does not grant extra privileges available to some potentially-untrusted context) essentially involve a security tradeoff. Still, in practice, I believe that attack surface reduction mechanisms (especially seccomp) are currently some of the most important defense mechanisms on Linux. Against bugs in source code: Compile-time locking validation The bug in TIOCSPGRP was a fairly straightforward violation of a straightforward locking rule: While a tty_struct is live, accessing its pgrp member is forbidden unless the ctrl_lock of the same tty_struct is held. This rule is sufficiently simple that it wouldn't be entirely unreasonable to expect the compiler to be able to verify it - as long as you somehow inform the compiler about this rule, because figuring out the intended locking rules just from looking at a piece of code can often be hard even for humans (especially when some of the code is incorrect). When you are starting a new project from scratch, the overall best way to approach this is to use a memory-safe language - in other words, a language that has explicitly been designed such that the programmer has to provide the compiler with enough information about intended memory safety semantics that the compiler can automatically verify them. But for existing codebases, it might be worth looking into how much of this can be retrofitted. Clang's Thread Safety Analysis feature does something vaguely like what we'd need to verify the locking in this situation: $ nl -ba -s' ' thread-safety-test.cpp | sed 's|^ ||' 1 struct __attribute__((capability(""mutex""))) mutex { 2 }; 3 4 void lock_mutex(struct mutex *p) __attribute__((acquire_capability(*p))); 5 void unlock_mutex(struct mutex *p) __attribute__((release_capability(*p))); 6 7 struct foo { 8 int a __attribute__((guarded_by(mutex))); 9 struct mutex mutex; 10 }; 11 12 int good(struct foo *p1, struct foo *p2) { 13 lock_mutex(&p1->mutex); 14 int result = p1->a; 15 unlock_mutex(&p1->mutex); 16 return result; 17 } 18 19 int bogus(struct foo *p1, struct foo *p2) { 20 lock_mutex(&p1->mutex); 21 int result = p2->a; 22 unlock_mutex(&p1->mutex); 23 return result; 24 } $ clang++ -c -o thread-safety-test.o thread-safety-test.cpp -Wall -Wthread-safety thread-safety-test.cpp:21:22: warning: reading variable 'a' requires holding mutex 'p2->mutex' [-Wthread-safety-precise] int result = p2->a; ^ thread-safety-test.cpp:21:22: note: found near match 'p1->mutex' 1 warning generated. $ However, this does not currently work when compiling as C code because the guarded_by attribute can't find the other struct member; it seems to have been designed mostly for use in C++ code. A more fundamental problem is that it also doesn't appear to have built-in support for distinguishing the different rules for accessing a struct member depending on the lifetime state of the object. For example, almost all objects with locked members will have initialization/destruction functions that have exclusive access to the entire object and can access members without locking. (The lock might not even be initialized in those states.) Some objects also have more lifetime states; in particular, for many objects with RCU-managed lifetime, only a subset of the members may be accessed through an RCU reference without having upgraded the reference to a refcounted one beforehand. Perhaps this could be addressed by introducing a new type attribute that can be used to mark pointers to structs in special lifetime states? (For C++ code, Clang's Thread Safety Analysis simply disables all checks in all constructor/destructor functions.) I am hopeful that, with some extensions, something vaguely like Clang's Thread Safety Analysis could be used to retrofit some level of compile-time safety against unintended data races. This will require adding a lot of annotations, in particular to headers, to document intended locking semantics; but such annotations are probably anyway necessary to enable productive work on a complex codebase. In my experience, when there are no detailed comments/annotations on locking rules, every attempt to change a piece of code you're not intimately familiar with (without introducing horrible memory safety bugs) turns into a foray into the thicket of the surrounding call graphs, trying to unravel the intentions behind the code. The one big downside is that this requires getting the development community for the codebase on board with the idea of backfilling and maintaining such annotations. And someone has to write the analysis tooling that can verify the annotations. At the moment, the Linux kernel does have some very coarse locking validation via sparse; but this infrastructure is not capable of detecting situations where the wrong lock is used or validating that a struct member is protected by a lock. It also can't properly deal with things like conditional locking, which makes it hard to use for anything other than spinlocks/RCU. The kernel's runtime locking validation via LOCKDEP is more advanced, but mostly with a focus on locking correctness of RCU pointers as well as deadlock detection (the main focus); again, there is no mechanism to, for example,automatically validate that a given struct member is only accessed under a specific lock (which would probably also be quite costly to implement with runtime validation). Also, as a runtime validation mechanism, it can't discover errors in code that isn't executed during testing (although it can combine separately observed behavior into race scenarios without ever actually observing the race). Against bugs in source code: Global static locking analysis An alternative approach to checking memory safety rules at compile time is to do it either after the entire codebase has been compiled, or with an external tool that analyzes the entire codebase. This allows the analysis tooling to perform analysis across compilation units, reducing the amount of information that needs to be made explicit in headers. This may be a more viable approach if peppering annotations everywhere across headers isn't viable; but it also reduces the utility to human readers of the code, unless the inferred semantics are made visible to them through some special code viewer. It might also be less ergonomic in the long run if changes to one part of the kernel could make the verification of other parts fail - especially if those failures only show up in some configurations. I think global static analysis is probably a good tool for finding some subsets of bugs, and it might also help with finding the worst-case depth of kernel stacks or proving the absence of deadlocks, but it's probably less suited for proving memory safety correctness? Against exploit primitives: Attack primitive reduction via syscall restrictions (Yes, I made up that name because I thought that capturing this under ""Attack surface reduction"" is too muddy.) Because allocator fastpaths (both in SLUB and in the page allocator) are implemented using per-CPU data structures, the ease and reliability of exploits that want to coax the kernel's memory allocators into reallocating memory in specific ways can be improved if the attacker has fine-grained control over the assignment of exploit threads to CPU cores. I'm calling such a capability, which provides a way to facilitate exploitation by influencing relevant system state/behavior, an ""attack primitive"" here. Luckily for us, Linux allows tasks to pin themselves to specific CPU cores without requiring any privilege using the sched_setaffinity() syscall. (As a different example, one primitive that can provide an attacker with fairly powerful capabilities is being able to indefinitely stall kernel faults on userspace addresses via FUSE or userfaultfd.) Just like in the section ""Attack surface reduction"" above, an attacker's ability to use these primitives can be reduced by filtering syscalls; but while the mechanism and the compatibility concerns are similar, the rest is fairly different: Attack primitive reduction does not normally reliably prevent a bug from being exploited; and an attacker will sometimes even be able to obtain a similar but shoddier (more complicated, less reliable, less generic, ...) primitive indirectly, for example: Instead of sched_setaffinity(), an attacker could attempt to launch several threads, let them poll getcpu() to figure out which cores they're running on, and then dispatch work to the threads as appropriate. Instead of delaying page faults with FUSE or userfaultfd, an attacker may be able to abuse discontiguous file mappings and scheduler behavior. Attack surface reduction is about limiting access to code that is suspected to contain exploitable bugs; in a codebase written in a memory-unsafe language, that tends to apply to pretty much the entire codebase. Attack surface reduction is often fairly opportunistic: You permit the things you need, and deny the rest by default. Attack primitive reduction limits access to code that is suspected or known to provide (sometimes very specific) exploitation primitives. For example, one might decide to specifically forbid access to FUSE and userfaultfd for most code because of their utility for kernel exploitation, and, if one of those interfaces is truly needed, design a workaround that avoids exposing the attack primitive to userspace. This is different from attack surface reduction, where it often makes sense to permit access to any feature that a legitimate workload wants to use. A nice example of an attack primitive reduction is the sysctl vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd, which was first introduced so that userfaultfd can be made completely inaccessible to normal users and was then later adjusted so that users can be granted access to part of its functionality without gaining the dangerous attack primitive. (But if you can create unprivileged user namespaces, you can still use FUSE to get an equivalent effect.) When maintaining lists of allowed syscalls for a sandboxed system component, or something along those lines, it may be a good idea to explicitly track which syscalls are explicitly forbidden for attack primitive reduction reasons, or similarly strong reasons - otherwise one might accidentally end up permitting them in the future. (I guess that's kind of similar to issues that one can run into when maintaining ACLs...) But like in the previous section, attack primitive reduction also tends to rely on making some functionality unavailable, and so it might not be viable in all situations. For example, newer versions of Android deliberately indirectly give apps access to FUSE through the AppFuse mechanism. (That API doesn't actually give an app direct access to /dev/fuse, but it does forward read/write requests to the app.) Against oops-based oracles: Lockout or panic on crash The ability to recover from kernel oopses in an exploit can help an attacker compensate for a lack of information about system state. Under some circumstances, it can even serve as a binary oracle that can be used to more or less perform a binary search for a value, or something like that. (It used to be even worse on some distributions, where dmesg was accessible for unprivileged users; so if you managed to trigger an oops or WARN, you could then grab the register states at all IRET frames in the kernel stack, which could be used to leak things like kernel pointers. Luckily nowadays most distributions, including Ubuntu 20.10, restrict dmesg access.) Android and Chrome OS nowadays set the kernel's panic_on_oops flag, meaning the machine will immediately restart when a kernel oops happens. This makes it hard to use oopsing as part of an exploit, and arguably also makes more sense from a reliability standpoint - the system will be down for a bit, and it will lose its existing state, but it will also reset into a known-good state instead of continuing in a potentially half-broken state, especially if the crashing thread was holding mutexes that can never again be released, or things like that. On the other hand, if some service crashes on a desktop system, perhaps that shouldn't cause the whole system to immediately go down and make you lose unsaved state - so panic_on_oops might be too drastic there. A good solution to this might require a more fine-grained approach. (For example, grsecurity has for a long time had the ability to lock out specific UIDs that have caused crashes.) Perhaps it would make sense to allow the init daemon to use different policies for crashes in different services/sessions/UIDs? Against UAF access: Deterministic UAF mitigation One defense that would reliably stop an exploit for this issue would be a deterministic use-after-free mitigation. Such a mitigation would reliably protect the memory formerly occupied by the object from accesses through dangling pointers to the object, at least once the memory has been reused for a different purpose (including reuse to store heap metadata). For write operations, this probably requires either atomicity of the access check and the actual write or an RCU-like delayed freeing mechanism. For simple read operations, it can also be implemented by ordering the access check after the read, but before the read value is used. A big downside of this approach on its own is that extra checks on every memory access will probably come with an extremely high efficiency penalty, especially if the mitigation can not make any assumptions about what kinds of parallel accesses might be happening to an object, or what semantics pointers have. (The proof-of-concept implementation I presented at LSSNA 2020 (slides, recording) had CPU overhead roughly in the range 60%-159% in kernel-heavy benchmarks, and ~8% for a very userspace-heavy benchmark.) Unfortunately, even a deterministic use-after-free mitigation often won't be enough to deterministically limit the blast radius of something like a refcounting mistake to the object in which it occurred. Consider a case where two codepaths concurrently operate on the same object: Codepath A assumes that the object is live and subject to normal locking rules. Codepath B knows that the reference count reached zero, assumes that it therefore has exclusive access to the object (meaning all members are mutable without any locking requirements), and is trying to tear down the object. Codepath B might then start dropping references the object was holding on other objects while codepath A is following the same references. This could then lead to use-after-frees on pointed-to objects. If all data structures are subject to the same mitigation, this might not be too much of a problem; but if some data structures (like struct page) are not protected, it might permit a mitigation bypass. Similar issues apply to data structures with union members that are used in different object states; for example, here's some random kernel data structure with an rcu_head in a union (just a random example, there isn't anything wrong with this code as far as I know): struct allowedips_node { struct wg_peer __rcu *peer; struct allowedips_node __rcu *bit[2]; /* While it may seem scandalous that we waste space for v4, * we're alloc'ing to the nearest power of 2 anyway, so this * doesn't actually make a difference. */ u8 bits[16] __aligned(__alignof(u64)); u8 cidr, bit_at_a, bit_at_b, bitlen; /* Keep rarely used list at bottom to be beyond cache line. */ union { struct list_head peer_list; struct rcu_head rcu; }; }; As long as everything is working properly, the peer_list member is only used while the object is live, and the rcu member is only used after the object has been scheduled for delayed freeing; so this code is completely fine. But if a bug somehow caused the peer_list to be read after the rcu member has been initialized, type confusion would result. In my opinion, this demonstrates that while UAF mitigations do have a lot of value (and would have reliably prevented exploitation of this specific bug), a use-after-free is just one possible consequence of the symptom class ""object state confusion"" (which may or may not be the same as the bug class of the root cause). It would be even better to enforce rules on object states, and ensure that an object e.g. can't be accessed through a ""refcounted"" reference anymore after the refcount has reached zero and has logically transitioned into a state like ""non-RCU members are exclusively owned by thread performing teardown"" or ""RCU callback pending, non-RCU members are uninitialized"" or ""exclusive access to RCU-protected members granted to thread performing teardown, other members are uninitialized"". Of course, doing this as a runtime mitigation would be even costlier and messier than a reliable UAF mitigation; this level of protection is probably only realistic with at least some level of annotations and static validation. Against UAF access: Probabilistic UAF mitigation; pointer leaks Summary: Some types of probabilistic UAF mitigation break if the attacker can leak information about pointer values; and information about pointer values easily leaks to userspace, e.g. through pointer comparisons in map/set-like structures. If a deterministic UAF mitigation is too costly, an alternative is to do it probabilistically; for example, by tagging pointers with a small number of bits that are checked against object metadata on access, and then changing that object metadata when objects are freed. The downside of this approach is that information leaks can be used to break the protection. One example of a type of information leak that I'd like to highlight (without any judgment on the relative importance of this compared to other types of information leaks) are intentional pointer comparisons, which have quite a few facets. A relatively straightforward example where this could be an issue is the kcmp() syscall. This syscall compares two kernel objects using an arithmetic comparison of their permuted pointers (using a per-boot randomized permutation, see kptr_obfuscate()) and returns the result of the comparison (smaller, equal or greater). This gives userspace a way to order handles to kernel objects (e.g. file descriptors) based on the identities of those kernel objects (e.g. struct file instances), which in turn allows userspace to group a set of such handles by backing kernel object in O(n*log(n)) time using a standard sorting algorithm. This syscall can be abused for improving the reliability of use-after-free exploits against some struct types because it checks whether two pointers to kernel objects are equal without accessing those objects: An attacker can allocate an object, somehow create a reference to the object that is not counted properly, free the object, reallocate it, and then verify whether the reallocation indeed reused the same address by comparing the dangling reference and a reference to the new object with kcmp(). If kcmp() includes the pointer's tag bits in the comparison, this would likely also permit breaking probabilistic UAF mitigations. Essentially the same concern applies when a kernel pointer is encrypted and then given to userspace in fuse_lock_owner_id(), which encrypts the pointer to a files_struct with an open-coded version of XTEA before passing it to a FUSE daemon. In both these cases, explicitly stripping tag bits would be an acceptable workaround because a pointer without tag bits still uniquely identifies a memory location; and given that these are very special interfaces that intentionally expose some degree of information about kernel pointers to userspace, it would be reasonable to adjust this code manually. A somewhat more interesting example is the behavior of this piece of userspace code: #define _GNU_SOURCE #include <sys/epoll.h> #include <sys/eventfd.h> #include <sys/resource.h> #include <err.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <sched.h> #define SYSCHK(x) ({ \ typeof(x) __res = (x); \ if (__res == (typeof(x))-1) \ err(1, ""SYSCHK("" #x "")""); \ __res; \ }) int main(void) { struct rlimit rlim; SYSCHK(getrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &rlim)); rlim.rlim_cur = rlim.rlim_max; SYSCHK(setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &rlim)); cpu_set_t cpuset; CPU_ZERO(&cpuset); CPU_SET(0, &cpuset); SYSCHK(sched_setaffinity(0, sizeof(cpuset), &cpuset)); int epfd = SYSCHK(epoll_create1(0)); for (int i=0; i<1000; i++) SYSCHK(eventfd(0, 0)); for (int i=0; i<192; i++) { int fd = SYSCHK(eventfd(0, 0)); struct epoll_event event = { .events = EPOLLIN, .data = { .u64 = i } }; SYSCHK(epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, fd, &event)); } char cmd[100]; sprintf(cmd, ""cat /proc/%d/fdinfo/%d"", getpid(), epfd); system(cmd); } It first creates a ton of eventfds that aren't used. Then it creates a bunch more eventfds and creates epoll watches for them, in creation order, with a monotonically incrementing counter in the ""data"" field. Afterwards, it asks the kernel to print the current state of the epoll instance, which comes with a list of all registered epoll watches, including the value of the data member (in hex).

With that knowledge, we can transform those numbers a bit, to show the order in which objects were allocated inside each page (excluding pages for which we haven't seen all allocations): $ cat slub_demo.py #!/usr/bin/env python3 blocks = [ [ 36, 46, 20, 25, 44, 38, 22, 29, 30, 45, 33, 28, 41, 31, 23, 37, 24, 50, 32, 26, 21, 43, 35, 48, 27, 39, 40, 47, 42, 34, 49, 19 ], [ 95, 105, 111, 84, 103, 97, 113, 88, 89, 104, 92, 87, 100, 90, 114, 96, 83, 109, 91, 85, 112, 102, 94, 107, 86, 98, 99, 106, 101, 93, 108, 110 ], [ 12, 1, 14, 5, 6, 9, 4, 17, 7, 13, 0, 8, 2, 11, 3, 15, 16, 18, 10 ], [ 135, 145, 119, 124, 143, 137, 121, 128, 129, 144, 132, 127, 140, 130, 122, 136, 123, 117, 131, 125, 120, 142, 134, 115, 126, 138, 139, 146, 141, 133, 116, 118 ], [ 66, 76, 82, 55, 74, 68, 52, 59, 60, 75, 63, 58, 71, 61, 53, 67, 54, 80, 62, 56, 51, 73, 65, 78, 57, 69, 70, 77, 72, 64, 79, 81 ], [ 177, 155, 161, 166, 153, 147, 163, 170, 171, 154, 174, 169, 150, 172, 164, 178, 165, 159, 173, 167, 162, 152, 176, 157, 168, 148, 149, 156, 151, 175, 158, 160 ], [ 186, 188, 179, 180, 183, 191, 181, 187, 182, 185, 189, 190, 184 ] ] for alloc_indices in blocks: if len(alloc_indices) != 32: continue # indices of allocations ('data'), sorted by memory location, shifted to be relative to the block alloc_indices_relative = [position - min(alloc_indices) for position in alloc_indices] # reverse mapping: memory locations of allocations, # sorted by index of allocation ('data'). # if we've observed all allocations in a page, # these will really be indices into the page. memory_location_by_index = [alloc_indices_relative.index(idx) for idx in range(0, len(alloc_indices))] print(memory_location_by_index) $ ./slub_demo.py [31, 2, 20, 6, 14, 16, 3, 19, 24, 11, 7, 8, 13, 18, 10, 29, 22, 0, 15, 5, 25, 26, 12, 28, 21, 4, 9, 1, 27, 23, 30, 17] [16, 3, 19, 24, 11, 7, 8, 13, 18, 10, 29, 22, 0, 15, 5, 25, 26, 12, 28, 21, 4, 9, 1, 27, 23, 30, 17, 31, 2, 20, 6, 14] [23, 30, 17, 31, 2, 20, 6, 14, 16, 3, 19, 24, 11, 7, 8, 13, 18, 10, 29, 22, 0, 15, 5, 25, 26, 12, 28, 21, 4, 9, 1, 27] [20, 6, 14, 16, 3, 19, 24, 11, 7, 8, 13, 18, 10, 29, 22, 0, 15, 5, 25, 26, 12, 28, 21, 4, 9, 1, 27, 23, 30, 17, 31, 2] [5, 25, 26, 12, 28, 21, 4, 9, 1, 27, 23, 30, 17, 31, 2, 20, 6, 14, 16, 3, 19, 24, 11, 7, 8, 13, 18, 10, 29, 22, 0, 15] And these sequences are almost the same, except that they have been rotated around by different amounts. This is exactly the SLUB freelist randomization scheme, as introduced in commit 210e7a43fa905! When a SLUB kmem_cache is created (an instance of the SLUB allocator for a specific size class and potentially other specific attributes, usually initialized at boot time), init_cache_random_seq and cache_random_seq_create fill an array ->random_seq with randomly-ordered object indices via Fisher-Yates shuffle, with the array length equal to the number of objects that fit into a page. Then, whenever SLUB grabs a new page from the lower-level page allocator, it initializes the page freelist using the indices from ->random_seq, starting at a random index in the array (and wrapping around when the end is reached). (I'm ignoring the low-order allocation fallback here.) So in summary, we can bypass SLUB randomization for the slab from which struct file is allocated because someone used it as a lookup key in a specific type of data structure. This is already fairly undesirable if SLUB randomization is supposed to provide protection against some types of local attacks for all slabs. The heap-randomization-weakening effect of such data structures is not necessarily limited to cases where elements of the data structure can be listed in-order by userspace: If there was a codepath that iterated through the tree in-order and freed all tree nodes, that could have a similar effect, because the objects would be placed on the allocator's freelist sorted by address, cancelling out the randomization. In addition, you might be able to leak information about iteration order through cache side channels or such. If we introduce a probabilistic use-after-free mitigation that relies on attackers not being able to learn whether the uppermost bits of an object's address changed after it was reallocated, this data structure could also break that. This case is messier than things like kcmp() because here the address ordering leak stems from a standard data structure. You may have noticed that some of the examples I'm using here would be more or less limited to cases where an attacker is reallocating memory with the same type as the old allocation, while a typical use-after-free attack ends up replacing an object with a differently-typed one to cause type confusion. As an example of a bug that can be exploited for privilege escalation without type confusion at the C structure level, see entry 808 in our bugtracker. My exploit for that bug first starts a writev() operation on a writable file, lets the kernel validate that the file is indeed writable, then replaces the struct file with a read-only file pointing to /etc/crontab, and lets writev() continue. This allows gaining root privileges through a use-after-free bug without having to mess around with kernel pointers, data structure layouts, ROP, or anything like that. Of course that approach doesn't work with every use-after-free though. (By the way: For an example of pointer leaks through container data structures in a JavaScript engine, see this bug I reported to Firefox back in 2016, when I wasn't a Google employee, which leaks the low 32 bits of a pointer by timing operations on pessimal hash tables - basically turning the HashDoS attack into an infoleak. Of course, nowadays, a side-channel-based pointer leak in a JS engine would probably not be worth treating as a security bug anymore, since you can probably get the same result with Spectre...) Against freeing SLUB pages: Preventing virtual address reuse beyond the slab (Also discussed a little bit on the kernel-hardening list in this thread.) A weaker but less CPU-intensive alternative to trying to provide complete use-after-free protection for individual objects would be to ensure that virtual addresses that have been used for slab memory are never reused outside the slab, but that physical pages can still be reused. This would be the same basic approach as used by PartitionAlloc and others. In kernel terms, that would essentially mean serving SLUB allocations from vmalloc space. Some challenges I can think of with this approach are: SLUB allocations are currently served from the linear mapping, which normally uses hugepages; if vmalloc mappings with 4K PTEs were used instead, TLB pressure might increase, which might lead to some performance degradation. To be able to use SLUB allocations in contexts that operate directly on physical memory, it is sometimes necessary for SLUB pages to be physically contiguous. That's not really a problem, but it is different from default vmalloc behavior. (Sidenote: DMA buffers don't always have to be physically contiguous - if you have an IOMMU, you can use that to map discontiguous pages to a contiguous DMA address range, just like how normal page tables create virtually-contiguous memory. See this kernel-internal API for an example that makes use of this, and Fuchsia's documentation for a high-level overview of how all this works in general.) Some parts of the kernel convert back and forth between virtual addresses, struct page pointers, and (for interaction with hardware) physical addresses. This is a relatively straightforward mapping for addresses in the linear mapping, but would become a bit more complicated for vmalloc addresses. In particular, page_to_virt() and phys_to_virt() would have to be adjusted. This is probably also going to be an issue for things like Memory Tagging, since pointer tags will have to be reconstructed when converting back to a virtual address. Perhaps it would make sense to forbid these helpers outside low-level memory management, and change existing users to instead keep a normal pointer to the allocation around? Or maybe you could let pointers to struct page carry the tag bits for the corresponding virtual address in unused/ignored address bits? The probability that this defense can prevent UAFs from leading to exploitable type confusion depends somewhat on the granularity of slabs; if specific struct types have their own slabs, it provides more protection than if objects are only grouped by size. So to improve the utility of virtually-backed slab memory, it would be necessary to replace the generic kmalloc slabs (which contain various objects, grouped only by size) with ones that are segregated by type and/or allocation site. (The grsecurity/PaX folks have vaguely alluded to doing something roughly along these lines using compiler instrumentation.) After reallocation as pagetable: Structure layout randomization Memory safety issues are often exploited in a way that involves creating a type confusion; e.g. exploiting a use-after-free by replacing the freed object with a new object of a different type. A defense that first appeared in grsecurity/PaX is to shuffle the order of struct members at build time to make it harder to exploit type confusions involving structs; the upstream Linux version of this is in scripts/gcc-plugins/randomize_layout_plugin.c. How effective this is depends partly on whether the attacker is forced to exploit the issue as a confusion between two structs, or whether the attacker can instead exploit it as a confusion between a struct and an array (e.g. containing characters, pointers or PTEs). Especially if only a single struct member is accessed, a struct-array confusion might still be viable by spraying the entire array with identical elements. Against the type confusion described in this blogpost (between struct pid and page table entries), structure layout randomization could still be somewhat effective, since the reference count is half the size of a PTE and therefore can randomly be placed to overlap either the lower or the upper half of a PTE. (Except that the upstream Linux version of randstruct only randomizes explicitly-marked structs or structs containing only function pointers, and struct pid has no such marking.) Of course, drawing a clear distinction between structs and arrays oversimplifies things a bit; for example, there might be struct types that have a large number of pointers of the same type or attacker-controlled values, not unlike an array. If the attacker can not completely sidestep structure layout randomization by spraying the entire struct, the level of protection depends on how kernel builds are distributed: If the builds are created centrally by one vendor and distributed to a large number of users, an attacker who wants to be able to compromise users of this vendor would have to rework their exploit to use a different type confusion for each release, which may force the attacker to rewrite significant chunks of the exploit. If the kernel is individually built per machine (or similar), and the kernel image is kept secret, an attacker who wants to reliably exploit a target system may be forced to somehow leak information about some structure layouts and either prepare exploits for many different possible struct layouts in advance or write parts of the exploit interactively after leaking information from the target system. To maximize the benefit of structure layout randomization in an environment where kernels are built centrally by a distribution/vendor, it would be necessary to make randomization a boot-time process by making structure offsets relocatable. (Or install-time, but that would break code signing.) Doing this cleanly (for example, such that 8-bit and 16-bit immediate displacements can still be used for struct member access where possible) would probably require a lot of fiddling with compiler internals, from the C frontend all the way to the emission of relocations. A somewhat hacky version of this approach already exists for C->BPF compilation as BPF CO-RE, using the clang builtin __builtin_preserve_access_index, but that relies on debuginfo, which probably isn't a very clean approach. Potential issues with structure layout randomization are: If structures are hand-crafted to be particularly cache-efficient, fully randomizing structure layout could worsen cache behavior. The existing randstruct implementation optionally avoids this by trying to randomize only within a cache line. Unless the randomization is applied in a way that is reflected in DWARF debug info and such (which it isn't in the existing GCC-based implementation), it can make debugging and introspection harder. It can break code that makes assumptions about structure layout; but such code is gross and should be cleaned up anyway (and Gustavo Silva has been working on fixing some of those issues). While structure layout randomization by itself is limited in its effectiveness by struct-array confusions, it might be more reliable in combination with limited heap partitioning: If the heap is partitioned such that only struct-struct confusion is possible, and structure layout randomization makes struct-struct confusion difficult to exploit, and no struct in the same heap partition has array-like properties, then it would probably become much harder to directly exploit a UAF as type confusion. On the other hand, if the heap is already partitioned like that, it might make more sense to go all the way with heap partitioning and create one partition per type instead of dealing with all the hassle of structure layout randomization. (By the way, if structure layouts are randomized, padding should probably also be randomized explicitly instead of always being on the same side to maximally randomize structure members with low alignment; see my list post on this topic for details.) Control Flow Integrity I want to explicitly point out that kernel Control Flow Integrity would have had no impact at all on this exploit strategy. By using a data-only strategy, we avoid having to leak addresses, avoid having to find ROP gadgets for a specific kernel build, and are completely unaffected by any defenses that attempt to protect kernel code or kernel control flow. Things like getting access to arbitrary files, increasing the privileges of a process, and so on don't require kernel instruction pointer control. Like in my last blogpost on Linux kernel exploitation (which was about a buggy subsystem that an Android vendor added to their downstream kernel), to me, a data-only approach to exploitation feels very natural and seems less messy than trying to hijack control flow anyway. Maybe things are different for userspace code; but for attacks by userspace against the kernel, I don't currently see a lot of utility in CFI because it typically only affects one of many possible methods for exploiting a bug. (Although of course there could be specific cases where a bug can only be exploited by hijacking control flow, e.g. if a type confusion only permits overwriting a function pointer and none of the permitted callees make assumptions about input types or privileges that could be broken by changing the function pointer.) Making important data readonly A defense idea that has shown up in a bunch of places (including Samsung phone kernels and XNU kernels for iOS) is to make data that is crucial to kernel security read-only except when it is intentionally being written to - the idea being that even if an attacker has an arbitrary memory write, they should not be able to directly overwrite specific pieces of data that are of exceptionally high importance to system security, such as credential structures, page tables, or (on iOS, using PPL) userspace code pages. The problem I see with this approach is that a large portion of the things a kernel does are, in some way, critical to the correct functioning of the system and system security. MMU state management, task scheduling, memory allocation, filesystems, page cache, IPC, ... - if any one of these parts of the kernel is corrupted sufficiently badly, an attacker will probably be able to gain access to all user data on the system, or use that corruption to feed bogus inputs into one of the subsystems whose own data structures are read-only. In my view, instead of trying to split out the most critical parts of the kernel and run them in a context with higher privileges, it might be more productive to go in the opposite direction and try to approximate something like a proper microkernel: Split out drivers that don't strictly need to be in the kernel and run them in a lower-privileged context that interacts with the core kernel through proper APIs. Of course that's easier said than done! But Linux does already have APIs for safely accessing PCI devices (VFIO) and USB devices from userspace, although userspace drivers aren't exactly its main usecase. (One might also consider making page tables read-only not because of their importance to system integrity, but because the structure of page table entries makes them nicer to work with in exploits that are constrained in what modifications they can make to memory. I dislike this approach because I think it has no clear conclusion and it is highly invasive regarding how data structures can be laid out.) Conclusion This was essentially a boring locking bug in some random kernel subsystem that, if it wasn't for memory unsafety, shouldn't really have much of a relevance to system security. I wrote a fairly straightforward, unexciting (and admittedly unreliable) exploit against this bug; and probably the biggest challenge I encountered when trying to exploit it on Debian was to properly understand how the SLUB allocator works. My intent in describing the exploit stages, and how different mitigations might affect them, is to highlight that the further a memory corruption exploit progresses, the more options an attacker gains; and so as a general rule, the earlier an exploit is stopped, the more reliable the defense is. Therefore, even if defenses that stop an exploit at an earlier point have higher overhead, they might still be more useful. I think that the current situation of software security could be dramatically improved - in a world where a little bug in some random kernel subsystem can lead to a full system compromise, the kernel can't provide reliable security isolation. Security engineers should be able to focus on things like buggy permission checks and core memory management correctness, and not have to spend their time dealing with issues in code that ought to not have any relevance to system security. In the short term, there are some band-aid mitigations that could be used to improve the situation - like heap partitioning or fine-grained UAF mitigation. These might come with some performance cost, and that might make them look unattractive; but I still think that they're a better place to invest development time than things like CFI, which attempts to protect against much later stages of exploitation. In the long term, I think something has to change about the programming language - plain C is simply too error-prone. Maybe the answer is Rust; or maybe the answer is to introduce enough annotations to C (along the lines of Microsoft's Checked C project, although as far as I can see they mostly focus on things like array bounds rather than temporal issues) to allow Rust-equivalent build-time verification of locking rules, object states, refcounting, void pointer casts, and so on. Or maybe another completely different memory-safe language will become popular in the end, neither C nor Rust? My hope is that perhaps in the mid-term future, we could have a statically verified, high-performance core of kernel code working together with instrumented, runtime-verified, non-performance-critical legacy code, such that developers can make a tradeoff between investing time into backfilling correct annotations and run-time instrumentation slowdown without compromising on security either way. TL;DR memory corruption is a big problem because small bugs even outside security-related code can lead to a complete system compromise; and to address that, it is important that we: in the short to medium term: design new memory safety mitigations: ideally, that can stop attacks at an early point where attackers don't have a lot of alternate options yet maybe at the memory allocator level (i.e. SLUB) that can't be broken using address tag leaks (or we try to prevent tag leaks, but that's really hard) continue using attack surface reduction in particular seccomp explicitly prevent untrusted code from gaining important attack primitives like FUSE, and potentially consider fine-grained scheduler control in the long term: statically verify correctness of most performance-critical code this will require determining how to retrofit annotations for object state and locking onto legacy C code consider designing runtime verification just for gaps in static verification Posted by Ryan at 9:08 AM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest No comments: Post a Comment Newer Post Older Post Home Subscribe to: Post Comments (Atom) Search This Blog Pages About Project Zero Working at Project Zero 0day ""In the Wild"" 0day Exploit Root Cause Analyses Vulnerability Disclosure FAQ Archives ▼  2021 (23) ►  December (1) ▼  October (3) Windows Exploitation Tricks: Relaying DCOM Authent...

117,Kubernetes,1,"Kubernetes Documentation Kubernetes Blog Training Partners Community Case Studies 	Versions Release Information v1.23 v1.22 v1.21 v1.20 v1.19 	English 中文 Chinese 한국어 Korean 日本語 Japanese Français Italiano Deutsch Español Português Bahasa Indonesia Tiếng Việt Русский Polski Українська Production-Grade Container Orchestration Learn Kubernetes Basics Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community. Planet Scale Designed on the same principles that allows Google to run billions of containers a week, Kubernetes can scale without increasing your ops team. Never Outgrow Whether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is. Run K8s Anywhere Kubernetes is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you. The Challenges of Migrating 150+ Microservices to Kubernetes By Sarah Wells, Technical Director for Operations and Reliability, Financial Times Watch Video Attend KubeCon Europe on May 17-20, 2022 Attend KubeCon North America on October 24-28, 2022 Kubernetes Features Automated rollouts and rollbacks Kubernetes progressively rolls out changes to your application or its configuration, while monitoring application health to ensure it doesn't kill all your instances at the same time. If something goes wrong, Kubernetes will rollback the change for you. Take advantage of a growing ecosystem of deployment solutions. Service discovery and load balancing No need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. Storage orchestration Automatically mount the storage system of your choice, whether from local storage, a public cloud provider such as GCP or AWS, or a network storage system such as NFS, iSCSI, Gluster, Ceph, Cinder, or Flocker. Secret and configuration management Deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your image and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration. Automatic bin packing Automatically places containers based on their resource requirements and other constraints, while not sacrificing availability. Mix critical and best-effort workloads in order to drive up utilization and save even more resources. Batch execution In addition to services, Kubernetes can manage your batch and CI workloads, replacing containers that fail, if desired. IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack Allocation of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services Horizontal scaling Scale your application up and down with a simple command, with a UI, or automatically based on CPU usage. Self-healing Restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve. Designed for extensibility Add features to your Kubernetes cluster without changing upstream source code.

If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in the Diagnostics page in your Merchant Center account. Submit a unique ID for each different product.Use the same value for item group ID [item_group_id] attribute for all variants of the same product. For example, a T-shirt comes in 9 variants: 3 sizes (small, medium, large) and 3 colors (red, blue, green). Submit each variant as a separate product (for a total of 9 separate products), and submit the same value for the item group ID attribute for each to indicate that these are variants of the same product. Each distinct item group must have a unique value for the item group ID [item_group_id]attribute. Don’t rely on casing to make the item group ID unique. The values ""abc123"" and ""ABC123"" are interpreted as the same product. Don’t reuse or recycle the same item group ID attribute for different products. Submit a variant attribute along with the item group ID attribute. When you submit an item group ID, make sure that your variants use at least one of the variant attributes: color [color], pattern [pattern], material [material], age group [age_group], gender [gender], size[size]. Use the same variant attributes for all products with the same item group ID. For example, if you submit a dress in 2 colors and 2 sizes, each product you submit must provide a value for the color [color] attribute and the size [size] attribute. Don't just provide the color or size for one dress, but not the others. Make sure that the product details displayed on your landing page match the values you provide for each attribute like title [title], color [color], pattern [pattern], material [material],price [price], availability [availability], and image link [image_link]. Learn more about requirements for landing pages Best practices These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your product data for performance. Use the parent SKU as the item group ID value for all variants of the same product. Don't submit a parent SKU as a separate product. If you'd like to group variants using a parent SKU, use the parent SKU as the value for the item group ID [item_group_id] attribute for all products in the variant group. Don’t mix up item group ID and ID attributes. Use the ID attribute to uniquely identify a single product, and use item group ID [item_group_id] to group together several products as variants. Don’t submit a value for the item group ID attribute if your product is not a variant. If your product is similar to other products, but not specifically a variant, don’t t submit the item group ID attribute. Some examples of products that are not variants include a suit consisting of a jacket and pants or a set of bath accessories. Use a stable item group ID value for each group of product variants. Once you've assigned an item group ID to a product, don't change it. If the item group ID changes often, it could cause inconsistency in the way variants are grouped and shown to customers. Don’t use the item group ID attribute for unsupported variants. If your product varies by an unsupported attribute (such as car make and model), or if your product is a build-to-order custom good with a large number of variants (more than 30), then don't use the item group ID attribute to indicate your variants. Review best practices for submitting unsupported variants To group and display product variants to customers on Buy on Google, make sure to add both the item group ID [item_group_id] attribute and a valid GTIN [gtin] to each variant of your product. If you’re a manufacturer or brand owner, you can sign up for Google Manufacturer Center, which allows manufacturers and brands to submit authoritative product data such as GTIN [gtin]. Learn more about GTINs Examples General examples Submit variant details through the variant attributes.

Apparel products Apparel products typically come in variants. Use the same item group ID [item_group_id] for each variant. Here’s an example that comes in 2 colors, each in 3 sizes. Note: The gender [gender] attribute may be mandatory depending on the country of sale, and is required in order for variant attributes to be displayed accurately.

To know so many people recall with great fondness their experiences and hearing the stories about friendships, mentorships and successes – it is really remarkable.”Special thanks go to George Lengvari, Bob Beriault, Richard MacKay, Barry Lorenzetti and the anonymous donors who offered lead gifts and matching gifts, adding some excitement to the day and encouraging others with their generosity.Contributions will help set up the Concordia Stingers for long-term success and will be instrumental in delivering exceptional experiences to our student-athletes.Your gift matters and we look forward to sharing updates on purchases and initiatives made possible by your support.The department’s Giving Tuesday page will accept donations through Dec. 31.

From Dec. 9-12. Yaremko, currently leads the Canada West conference in points with 13 goals and seven assists previously played with the Stockton Heat in the American Hockey League, the NHL’s Calgary Flames minor-league affiliate, before joining the Mount Royal Cougars during the 2019-20 season. Yaremko is joined by fellow Mount Royal Cougar, Sawchuk, whose 20 points through 12 games is tied for first in points in Canada West with Yaremko. Sawchuk has tallied eight goals and 12 assists on the season thus far. Sawchuk is in his first year at Mount Royal. The roster includes three returning players with All-Star series experience. Defenceman Clayton Kirichenko and forward Grayson Pawlenchuk represented the Alberta Golden Bears in 2019, while forward Ryley Lindgren of the MRU Cougars is set to make a second appearance as a U SPORTS All-Star. Pawlenchuk will serve as the U SPORTS captain, while Kirichenko and Lindgren will don the alternate captain title. This will mark the sixth year the U SPORTS All-Stars have faced off against Canada’s National Junior Team Prospects, who are vying for roster spots at the 2022 IIHF World Junior Hockey Championship being held in Edmonton and Red Deer, Alta. From Dec. 26 2021 – Jan. 5, 2022. “This is an excellent opportunity for U SPORTS to show our continued support for Hockey Canada in helping them best prepare the Canadian World Junior Team for the IIHF World Junior Hockey Championship in Edmonton and Red Deer,” said Lisette Johnson-Stapley, Chief Sport Officer of U SPORTS. “We are honoured to be invited annually to the selection camp, while simultaneously showcasing some of the best talent Canadian university hockey has to offer. We greatly appreciate Hockey Canada’s support in hosting some of Canada’s top university players.” U SPORTS has selected players exclusively from Alberta schools to represent the All-Star team in order to minimize COVID risks throughout the selection tournament. Canada’s National Junior Team selection camp will be held at the WinSport Arena at Canada Olympic Park in Calgary and will include practices and two games against the U SPORTS all-stars. The games are scheduled for Dec. 11 at 8 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. PT and Dec. 12 at 4 p.m. ET / 1 p.m. PT. Bert Gilling, head coach of the Mount Royal Cougars, will serve as the team’s bench boss. Gilling will be joined by Ian Herbers of the Alberta Golden Bears and Mike Ringrose of the MacEwan Griffins behind the bench, with Nathan Higgins of Mount Royal acting as Team Leader for the All-Star squad.

When you use this attribute, your product can appear in results that are filtered by size. The size you submit will also affect how your product variants are shown. When to use Required for enhanced free listings for all Apparel & Accessories > Clothing (ID 1604) and Apparel & Accessories > Shoes (ID 187) products Required for Shopping ads for Apparel & Accessories > Clothing (ID 1604) and Apparel & Accessories > Shoes (ID 187) products when targeting these countries: Brazil France Germany Japan United Kingdom United States Format Follow these formatting guidelines to make sure Google understands the data you're submitting. For details on when and how to submit values in English, learn more about submitting your product data Type String (Unicode characters. Recommended: ASCII only) Limits 1–100 characters Repeated field No   Schema.org property (What’s this?) Product.size, Type: Text File format Example value Text feeds XL XML feeds <g:size>XL</g:size> To format your data for Content API, see the Content API for Shopping. Guidelines Follow these guidelines to make sure you submit high-quality data for your products. Minimum requirements These are the requirements you'll need to meet to show your product. If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in the Diagnostics page in your Merchant Center account. Use a standard size value for your country of sale. Learn more about what types of values are recognized Submit only one attribute per product. If you provide multiple size attributes for the same product, only the first will be applied. Additional size attributes will be discarded, and you will receive a warning. Submit only the size value. Don’t submit values such as ""n/a"", ""none"", or ""multisize"". Make sure to submit non-size information through the correct attribute, such as color [color], material [material], and pattern [pattern]. Submit this attribute for all products that vary by size. For apparel products, use this attribute when your product is a variant that is distinguished by its size. For example, use “S” as the value for a ""small red T-shirt"" and use “L” as the value for a ""large red T-shirt"". Also submit each variant as a separate product with the same value for the item group ID [item_group_id] attribute. Don’t submit multiple sizes separated by a comma ( , ). Instead, use a slash. For example, enter ""small/medium/large"" (and not ""small, medium, large""). For products with multiple dimensions, don’t submit multiple sizes separated by a comma (,). Instead, condense multiple dimensions into one size value using a slash. For example, enter 16/34 to represent a neck size of 16 inches and a sleeve length of 34 inches. For non-apparel products, submit the relevant size. Sizes for different types of products vary widely, but providing this information can help ensure that your product is shown to the right users. Best practices These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your product data for performance. Provide values that your users will understand. The values that you provide could be shown to users, so make sure that values you submit can be understood by your users. Use a consistent format for size. For example, imagine you’re selling a shirt that comes in small, medium, and large. For those variants, submit ""S"", ""M"", and ""L"". Don’t submit ""S"", ""Medium"", and ""Lrg"". The size that you submit is standardized before it’s shown to users. By submitting consistent sizes, you can help ensure that the size is standardized correctly. Provide more size details using the other size attributes. Provide the cut of your garment using the size type [size_type] attribute. Indicate the country convention for your size with the size system [size_system] attribute. Submit the complete size of your product. If your product size has several components, make sure to submit all of this information. Otherwise, the size could be misunderstood, and it might not be standardized or shown to the correct users. For example, if you sell shoes in different widths, you should specify the width in the size [size] attribute. So, instead of just submitting size ""8"", you'd submit size ""8 N"" to represent ""8 narrow"". For retailer-defined multipack products, please submit the multipack quantity using the multipack [multipack] attribute. Do not submit the multipack quantity as a part of the size. Additional guidelines Review each section closely to determine if the requirements apply to your country or product. If you don't follow requirements that apply to you, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in Diagnostics in your Merchant Center account. Standard sizes (all countries and apparel categories) Sample values Examples One size fits all OSFA OS one size Small, medium, and large sizes (including ranges): XXS, XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL, 4XL, 5XL, 6XL XS S 2XL S-M XL/2XL Baby sizing in months, including ranges 6 Mo 3-6 Mo 12-18 Mo Size followed by Toddler 2 Toddler 3 Toddler General numeric sizes, including fractional sizes (standard ranges for specific countries and categories): 000–100 00 12 48.5 48 1/2 75 Standard number ranges (all countries and categories) We support any whole number 0-100, and some fractional sizes (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc.) are also accepted.

The tool also shows a preview of a Google search result page for a specific term. This helps you see which ads and extensions are appearing for your keyword. Once you enter a search term and other criteria like language and location, the tool will tell you whether your ad is eligible to appear in that situation. The Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool suggests search term auto-completions as you type. Suggestions come from keywords with impressions in your account, and are ordered by volume. Use this tool to check if your ad extension is showing with an ad for a particular keyword. If any of your extensions aren't showing, the tool will tell you what might be causing them not to show. Use the 'Share this search' feature to bookmark specific searches or to send the URL to colleagues or clients so they can view Google search results for this particular search as well. Keep in mind that the search results returned by this tool may change over time. For example, a preview of your ad may no longer appear in the tool when your campaign reaches its average daily budget. ​If you want to see how your ad appears in search results, it's better to use this tool than to do a search on Google. You'll see the exact same results as a Google search but it won't affect your performance stats by accumulating ad impressions every time you search for your ad. To use the Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool, click the tools icon at the top right of your Google Ads account then click on Ad Preview and Diagnosis under the ‘Planning’ section. You can also go right to google.com/AdPreview.   Learn more How to use the Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool About keyword and placement diagnosis See articles on why your ad doesn't show Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit Need more help?

The chapel is a consecrated Roman Catholic space open to people of all faiths and interests concerned with explorations of self and connectedness. The chapel serves communities within the university and west end of Montreal as a unique space that supports initiatives aligned with values of well-being, spirituality, identity, kinship and social justice. Chapel History Following the opening of the Loyola Campus by the Jesuits in 1916, the Loyola Chapel was built in 1933, during the Great Depression. It was designed by architect Henri Labelle in an English Gothic Scholastic style and built by Anglin Norcross Construction, Ontario. The chapel is named in memory of Charles Francis Smith and Margaret McNally, parents of Francis C. Smith, S.J. (Society of Jesus). When Father Smith, a Loyola graduate, took his final vows of poverty within the Jesuit Order, a portion of his family inheritance was put toward the construction of the chapel and the F.C. Smith Auditorium, providing a parish church for the wider community and a venue for theatre, music and cinema on campus until the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall was built in 1990. Since the merger of Sir George Williams University and Loyola College in 1974 to create Concordia, the chapel has been an ecumenical place of worship in which many different religious services and events have taken place. In 2009 a revitalization process was put in place to further explore the breadth of groups and activities the Chapel can support as a sacred space. An extensive history of the Loyola Chapel can be found at Concordia's Archives & Records Management. Booking the Chapel Please feel free to propose an event or happening in the space.

Learn more about the format requirements for repeated and/or group attributes in text feeds Learn more about the format requirements for repeated and/or group attributes in Google sheets Learn more about the product_highlight attribute in the Content API Guidelines Follow these guidelines to make sure you submit high-quality data for your products. Minimum requirements These are the requirements you'll need to meet to show your product. If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in the Diagnostics page in your Merchant Center account. Each product must have at least 2 and at most 10 product highlights. We recommend 4-6 product highlights for each of your products. Describe only the product itself. Don't describe other aspects like details about compatible products, accessories, other similar products available. Don't provide your business’s history or policies. Use professional and grammatically correct language. Correct grammar is easier to understand and gives you a more professional appearance, which can lead to more clicks. Also avoid gimmicky ways of drawing attention such as all caps, symbols, and promotional text. Learn more about the editorial & professional requirements Don’t use words from foreign languages, unless they’re well understood such as a product with a foreign name or title. For example, “sushi” is a word well understood outside of Japan. Write foreign words using the alphabet of your target language. For example, avoid Japanese characters when targeting the United States. Letters with accents (for example, “Les Clés"") are allowed. Don’t use foreign characters for gimmicky purposes. This technique is common in spam and untrustworthy ads and product listings. For example: (ಠ_ಠ) Don’t include comparisons or details about other products. For example, don't mention things like ""even better than X."" Let customers research other products on their own. Don’t include references to categorization systems. For example, don’t include ""Toys & Games > Toys > Dolls, Playsets & Toy Figures > Dolls."" Include this information using the Google product category [google_product_category] or product type [product_type] attributes. Don’t include links to your store or other websites. Use the link [link] attribute to include a link to your product's landing page. Don’t use capital letters for emphasis. Capitalized text is common in spam and untrustworthy ads and product listings. You should still use capitalization when it’s appropriate, including for abbreviations, phone numbers, countries, and currency. For example, ""ADHD"", ""UNICEF"", ""1-555-CALL-NOW"", ""UK"", and ""USD"". Don’t include promotional text. Don’t add information such as price, sale price, sale dates, shipping, delivery date, other time-related information, or your company’s name. Include this information with the other attributes such as the sale price [sale_price] or shipping [shipping] attributes. Don't list keywords or search terms. Only list relevant details and specifications of the product. Best practices These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your product data for performance. Don't duplicate data within the attribute. Don't use search engine optimization (SEO) keywords. Check for errors in grammar, spelling, or capitalization.

Individuals should reduce the amount of time that they are inactive and take the opportunity to make the active choice every chance they get. Physical activities can be placed into two main categories — aerobic activities and muscle and bone strengthening activities — with aerobic activities providing the greatest benefits. Experts recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity per week: that’s only 30 minutes a day on 5 days of the week. Exercising too much can lead to consequences such as sleep problems, heart problems, irritability, depression and injury.

Two Concordia postdocs are highlighting the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on transgender scientists in a recently published letter in the academic journal Science. Shaun Turney, Lilian Sales and eight co-authors from Brazilian universities and the Kunhã Asé Network of Women in Science say the crisis has magnified existing challenges within the discipline and broader society and sparked conversations among scientists about creating a more equitable and inclusive community. The group conducts science outreach action targeted at young women and girls and monitors and supports women already in the profession. “Transgender scientists should be a part of these conversations to ensure that their needs are recognized as we strive to make science more diverse and inclusive,” the letter says. Turney is an insect ecologist studying ant ecology and Sales is a Horizon 2020 postdoctoral fellow. They met when Sales joined the labs of Pedro Peres-Neto, Concordia professor of biology, and Jean-Philippe Lessard, Concordia associate professor of biology, at the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science. Sales is working in one Brazilian lab and remotely in two Concordia labs due to the pandemic. She holds a PhD in ecological evolution and works on global ecology and conservation biogeography. She is studying the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, deforestation of the Amazon, alien species invasion and ecosystem services. Sales was already affiliated with the Kunhã Asé Network, which recently published a letter in Nature Ecology and Evolution about the effects of the pandemic on minority groups including women scientists, early-career scientists, researchers from the Global South and disabled people. The group wanted to build on that work by looking at the pandemic’s impact on transgender scientists, and Sales invited Turney to co-author the piece. “The pandemic has highlighted and increased different systems of oppression that are intersectional. After our first letter addressing how the pandemic could affect minority groups, we realized that trans people were not being included in the discussion,” Sales says. “When I met Shaun, he was very interested in this discussion and had a personal perspective to share.” She notes the letter was co-authored by four trans and six cisgender scientists. ‘An outsized share of the poverty, disease and exclusion from science’ The letter explains that transgender people face several barriers to success in the sciences, including a cisnormative science curriculum, bullying and a lack of family support during youth, which contribute to higher dropout rates for trans students. They also experience harassment and mental-health challenges in university and the workplace. Trans people are often denied health care, an issue likely exacerbated as countries’ medical systems deal with the pandemic. They’re often disadvantaged by biases in hiring decisions, and those with less-established careers may be more vulnerable to pandemic-related funding cuts and firings. “The disruptions caused by COVID-19 have likely burdened transgender scientists with an outsized share of the poverty, disease and exclusion from science,” Turney, Sales and their co-authors write. However, they argue, this moment presents an opportunity to create a profession that’s welcoming of all gender identities. The authors advocate for respecting chosen names and pronouns, speaking out against anti-trans policies and laws and actively challenging harmful perspectives within the profession. Institutions should also play a role by developing inclusive name-change policies, allocating funding to support trans scientists’ career development and broadening access to inclusive health care. “We’re trying to build a healthier environment in academia that’s more accepting of people’s individualities. We finish the letter saying that the post-pandemic world gives us a window of opportunity to rethink what we want the science community to be and the kind of collaboration we want to build,” Sales says. “As we resume our activities in the lab and our universities, we have this opportunity to rethink stereotypes, rethink our institutional spaces to embrace different gender identities and other individual needs — for example people with disabilities, or to include children in our working spaces to support working parents. It is possible. We don’t need to exclude what is different to create a working environment.” ‘Scientists are people too and all people have biases’ Turney earned his master’s degree on Lyme disease ecology at McGill University, particularly examining the role of ticks in transmission. That work drove his interest in arthropods and insects. He completed his PhD at McGill studying spider ecology under the supervision of Chris Buddle, a professor of natural resource sciences. He has since worked in the Yukon and authored papers on ecological questions including the effects of road proximity on arthropod communities and how species interactions are associated with methane and carbon dioxide gas fluxes. Today, Turney is using data sets on ants collected from 50 locations in North and Central America to learn why so many, or so few, species of ants are found in particular locations. Turney says he’s been very blessed to face little overt transphobia throughout his career and to work with open, accepting colleagues. But he worries about his future career in a highly competitive industry, made even more so by a pandemic that has forced layoffs and hiring freezes at universities across the world. “My colleagues have always been very open-minded and accepting, I think that’s a common trait in scientists — the culture is typically very open-minded. That being said, scientists are people too and all people have biases,” he says. “Everyone applying to faculty positions is qualified; they have a PhD, published papers and teaching experience. A hiring committee would be very justified in choosing many different people, and that’s the kind of situation where unconscious bias can play a huge role,” he adds. “I worry that that is playing a role in my difficulty finding work — it’s really hard to say when it comes to bias like that. What is just ‘it’s hard to find work’ and what is people looking at me and saying, ‘you don’t look like what I think a professor should look like’?” Reflecting on the letter in Science, Turney points to a comment from United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, who described the pandemic as an X-ray, “revealing fractures in the fragile skeleton of the society we have built.” He says that concept is exactly why he and his co-authors decided to write the letter. “Transgender scientists, like other marginalized groups, have certain challenges in normal times and the pandemic is really revealing those issues and making them worse. This is an interesting moment to be talking about those problems that were there before and continue to be here,” he says. “We’re all away from our workplaces, so it just seems like a good moment to take a step back and look at our scientific culture. Things are going to be different when we go back to our universities. It would be great if we could make it different in an intentional way.” The letter, ""Support transgender scientists post–COVID-19"" appears in the September 4, 2020, edition of the journal Science.   Related topics 	 research 	 	 COVID-19 	 	 gender 	 You might also like: Gay, lesbian and bisexual teens in lockdown at increased risk, new research shows Combatting discrimination is a prominent pandemic issue, according to Concordia researcher Trending Concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the Montreal Climate Partnership November 10, 2021 Improvements to Concordia’s Henry F.

This article explains our efforts to create an understandable and useful resource for our advertisers around the world. Why use the Google Ads Help Center Our goal is to make the Google Ads Help Center understandable and useful to hundreds of thousands of advertisers around the world. We've tried to strike the right balance, giving you the information you need to effectively run your campaigns without bogging you down with the under-the-hood details of a highly complex system. How the Google Ads Help Center works Because our Help Center isn't written for computer science engineers, these articles shouldn't be used to understand the technical details of any particular component of our systems. The articles are written to provide advertisers with a conceptual, non-technical understanding of how Google Ads works. You can learn more about Google Ads by checking out the articles in each topic, or by typing your question into the search box at the top of the page. We might personalize the information you see in the Help Center based on the account that you're currently signed in to. By personalizing the content, we hope to make it easier for you to find the answers you need, fix problems in your account, and make the most out of your advertising efforts. As part of your Google Ads experience, we may conduct research, testing, or experiments that may affect the look and feel of your ads or your campaign performance.  During your participation in these experiments, the descriptions and explanations in this Help Center may not apply to you.  For more information about research and testing in Google Ads, see How Google improves Google Ads. We work hard to provide practical information for the average advertiser using our ads products. We hope you find this Help Center useful, and thank you for using Google Ads. How to share your feedback We appreciate your feedback on Help Center. Please let us know how we're doing by rating how helpful each article was at the bottom of the page, or share your opinions and suggestions to help us make our product better.

Learn about promotions. When to use Optional for each product Not available for free listings If you're using a promotion with the products eligible for promotion [product_applicability]attribute set to specific_products, you can use the promotion ID [promotion_id] attribute in both your product and promotion data to match a product to a promotion. Review the promotions feed specification. Using the promotion ID attribute helps Google to understand which products have promotions so that we can display the promotions appropriately. Format Follow these formatting guidelines to make sure Google understands the data you're submitting. For details on when and how to submit values in English, learn more about submitting your product data Type Unicode characters (Recommended: ASCII only): alphanumeric, underscores, and dashes  Limits 1–50 characters Repeated field Up to 10 times   File format Example value Text feeds tbby123_us XML feeds <g:promotion_id>tbby123_us</g:promotion_id> To format your data for Content API, see the Content API for Shopping. Guidelines Follow these guidelines to make sure you submit high-quality data for your products. Minimum requirements These are the requirements you'll need to meet to show your product. If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in the Diagnostics page in your Merchant Center account. Submit the promotion ID attribute for the specific products in a promotion if the promotion uses the products eligible for promotion [product_applicability] attribute and it is set to specific_products. If the promotion uses the products eligible for promotion attribute and it is set to all_products, then the promotion ID code [promotion_id] attribute isn't needed, since the promotion applies to all of your products. Use a unique ID for each different promotion. The ID allows you and Google to distinguish each promotion. Use a stable ID for each promotion. Once you've assigned an ID to a promotion, don't change it. The ID you choose identifies the promotion and is used to track the product's performance history in Merchant Center and Google Ads. If you change the ID, you'll overwrite your promotion and its history. Don’t reuse or recycle the same ID for different promotions. For example: Don’t reuse an ID for different promotions in the same target country or language. Don’t recycle an ID for new promotions. Even if you’re not running a promotion anymore, don't use that promotion's ID for any other promotion. Assign a unique ID for a new promotion. Avoid white space. Consecutive white spaces and white spaces before and after the ID will be automatically removed. Use casing to make IDs unique if needed. For example, we interpret the ID ""abc123"" and ""ABC123"" as different promotions. Don't submit symbols.For example % or ! Don't submit invalid unicode characters. These characters are generally added during your file's encoding process. To avoid them, use UTF-8 encoding. To help prevent encoding issues, submit files in a compressed format. Examples of invalid unicode characters include: Control characters (e.g., U+200D) Function characters Private area characters Surrogate pairs Unassigned code points Best practices These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your product data for performance. Match a product to more than one promotion by submitting the promotion ID [promotion_id] attribute up to 10 times per product. Examples Promotion applies to specific products Use the same value for the promotion ID [promotion_id] attribute in your product data and promotions data when a promotion applies to a product.

A healthy diet consists mainly of plant foods such as fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. beans, lentils, chickpeas), whole grains, nuts and seeds.

Olivier Roy named one of Quebec's top sports personalities The Journal de Montréal named Concordia Stingers quarterback Olivier Roy one of its top sports personalities of 2021 in an article published today.In collaboration with Léger, a respected market research and polling firm, the newspaper conducted a survey asking the question, “Who is the Quebec sports personality of the year?” The survey took place Nov. 26-28 and polled 1,049 Quebecers aged 18 and over.Twenty-four athletes made the list that featured well-known celebrities like No. 1-ranked Laurent Duvernay-Tardif, the medical doctor who plays for the NFL’s New York Jets, and No. 5-ranked Jonathan Drouin of the Montreal Canadiens.Roy was listed 24th in the final spot. He was the only RSEQ athlete to be honoured. He was one of three football players on the list behind Duvernay-Tardif and Alexandre Dupuis (No. 14), a fullback with the Saskatchewan Roughriders.""I'm sure he will get teased a bit"", said head coach Concordia Stingers Brad Collinson. ""But at the end of the day, this is great for Concordia football and demonstrates how our program is moving forward. It's also a positive reflection on the role university football plays in Quebec.""Roy, the third-year student-athlete from Donnacona, Que., had a record-setting season with the Stingers.

Google Online Security Blog: Linux Kernel Security Done Right
",1,"Google Online Security Blog: Linux Kernel Security Done Right Security Blog The latest news and insights from Google on security and safety on the Internet Linux Kernel Security Done Right August 3, 2021 Posted by Kees Cook, Software Engineer, Google Open Source Security TeamTo borrow from an excellent analogy between the modern computer ecosystem and the US automotive industry of the 1960s, the Linux kernel runs well: when driving down the highway, you're not sprayed in the face with oil and gasoline, and you quickly get where you want to go. However, in the face of failure, the car may end up on fire, flying off a cliff.As we approach its 30th Anniversary, Linux still remains the largest collaborative development project in the history of computing. The huge community surrounding Linux allows it to do amazing things and run smoothly. What's still missing, though, is sufficient focus to make sure that Linux fails well too. There's a strong link between code robustness and security: making it harder for any bugs to manifest makes it harder for security flaws to manifest. But that's not the end of the story. When flaws do manifest, it's important to handle them effectively.Rather than only taking a one-bug-at-a-time perspective, preemptive actions can stop bugs from having bad effects. With Linux written in C, it will continue to have a long tail of associated problems. Linux must be designed to take proactive steps to defend itself from its own risks. Cars have seat belts not because we want to crash, but because it is guaranteed to happen sometimes.Even though everyone wants a safe kernel running on their computer, phone, car, or interplanetary helicopter, not everyone is in a position to do something about it. Upstream kernel developers can fix bugs, but have no control over what a downstream vendor chooses to incorporate into their products. End users get to choose their products, but don't usually have control over what bugs are fixed nor what kernel is used (a problem in itself). Ultimately, vendors are responsible for keeping their product's kernels safe.What to fix?The statistics of tracking and fixing distinct bugs are sobering. The stable kernel releases (""bug fixes only"") each contain close to 100 new fixes per week. Faced with this high rate of change, a vendor can choose to ignore all the fixes, pick out only ""important"" fixes, or face the daunting task of taking everything.Fix nothing?With the preponderance of malware, botnets, and state surveillance targeting flawed software, it's clear that ignoring all fixes is the wrong ""solution."" Unfortunately this is the very common stance of vendors who see their devices as just a physical product instead of a hybrid product/service that must be regularly updated.Fix important flaws?Between the dereliction of doing nothing and the assumed burden of fixing everything, the traditional vendor choice has been to cherry-pick only the ""important"" fixes. But what constitutes ""important"" or even relevant? Just determining whether to implement a fix takes developer time.The prevailing wisdom has been to choose vulnerabilities to fix based on the Mitre CVE list, presuming all important flaws (and therefore fixes) would have an associated CVE. However, given the volume of flaws and their applicability to a particular system, not all security flaws have CVEs assigned, nor are they assigned in a timely manner. Evidence shows that for Linux CVEs, more than 40% had been fixed before the CVE was even assigned, with the average delay being over three months after the fix. Some fixes went years without having their security impact recognized. On top of this, product-relevant bugs may not even classify for a CVE. Finally, upstream developers aren't actually interested in CVE assignment; they spend their limited time actually fixing bugs.A vendor relying on cherry-picking is all but guaranteed to miss important vulnerabilities that others are actively fixing, which is almost worse than doing nothing since it creates the illusion that security updates are being appropriately handled.Fix everything!So what is a vendor to do? The answer is simple, if painful: continuously update to the latest kernel release, either major or stable. Tracking major releases means gaining security improvements along with bug fixes, while stable releases are bug fixes only. For example, although modern Android phones ship with kernels that are based on major releases from almost two to four years earlier, Android vendors do now, thankfully, track stable kernel releases. So even though the features being added to newer major kernels will be missing, all the latest stable kernel fixes are present.Performing continuous kernel updates (major or stable) understandably faces enormous resistance within an organization due to fear of regressions—will the update break the product? The answer is usually that a vendor doesn't know, or that the update frequency is shorter than their time needed for testing. But the problem with updating is not that the kernel might cause regressions; it's that vendors don't have sufficient test coverage and automation to know the answer. Testing must take priority over individual fixes.Make it happenOne question remains: how to possibly support all the work continuous updates require? As it turns out, it’s a simple resource allocation problem, and is more easily accomplished than might be imagined: downstream redundancy can be moved into greater upstream collaboration.More engineers for fixing bugs earlierWith vendors using old kernels and backporting existing fixes, their engineering resources are doing redundant work. For example, instead of 10 companies each assigning one engineer to backport the same fix independently, those developer hours could be shifted to upstream work where 10 separate bugs could be fixed for everyone in the Linux ecosystem. This would help address the growing backlog of bugs. Looking at just one source of potential kernel security flaws, the syzkaller dashboard shows the number of open bugs is currently approaching 900 and growing by about 100 a year, even with about 400 a year being fixed.More engineers for code reviewBeyond just squashing bugs after the fact, more focus on upstream code review will help stem the tide of their introduction in the first place, with benefits extending beyond just the immediate bugs caught. Capable code review bandwidth is a limited resource. Without enough people dedicated to upstream code review and subsystem maintenance tasks, the entire kernel development process bottlenecks.Long-term Linux robustness depends on developers, but especially on effective kernel maintainers. Although there is effort in the industry to train new developers, this has been traditionally justified only by the ""feature driven"" jobs they can get. But focusing only on product timelines ultimately leads Linux into the Tragedy of the Commons. Expanding the number of maintainers can avoid it. Luckily the ""pipeline"" for new maintainers is straightforward.Maintainers are built not only from their depth of knowledge of a subsystem's technology, but also from their experience with mentorship of other developers and code review. Training new reviewers must become the norm, motivated by making upstream review part of the job. Today's reviewers become tomorrow's maintainers. If each major kernel subsystem gained four more dedicated maintainers, we could double productivity.More engineers for testing and infrastructureAlong with more reviewers, improving Linux's development workflow is critical to expanding everyone's ability to contribute. Linux's ""email only"" workflow is showing its age, but the upstream development of more automated patch tracking, continuous integration, fuzzing, coverage, and testing will make the development process significantly more efficient.Additionally, instead of testing kernels after they're released, it's more effective to test during development. When tests are performed against unreleased kernel versions (e.g. linux-next) and reported upstream, developers get immediate feedback about bugs. Fixes can be developed before a flaw is ever actually released; it's always easier to fix a bug earlier than later.This ""upstream first"" approach to product kernel development and testing is extremely efficient. Google has been successfully doing this with Chrome OS and Android for a while now, and is hardly alone in the industry. It means feature development happens against the latest kernel, and devices are similarly tested as close as possible to the latest upstream kernels, all avoiding duplicated ""in-house"" effort.More engineers for security and toolchain developmentBesides dealing reactively to individual bugs and existing maintenance needs, there is also the need to proactively eliminate entire classes of flaws, so developers cannot introduce these types of bugs ever again. Why fix the same kind of security vulnerability 10 times a year when we can stop it from ever appearing again?Over the last few years, various fragile language features and kernel APIs have been eliminated or replaced (e.g. VLAs, switch fallthrough, addr_limit). However, there is still plenty more work to be done. One of the most time-consuming aspects has been the refactoring involved in making these usually invasive and context-sensitive changes across Linux's 25 million lines of code.Beyond kernel code itself, the compiler and toolchain also need to grow more defensive features (e.g. variable zeroing, CFI, sanitizers). With the toolchain technically ""outside"" the kernel, its development effort is often inappropriately overlooked and underinvested. Code safety burdens need to be shifted as much as possible to the toolchain, freeing humans to work in other areas. On the most progressive front, we must make sure Linux can be written in memory-safe languages like Rust.Don't wait another minuteIf you're not using the latest kernel, you don't have the most recently added security defenses (including bug fixes). In the face of newly discovered flaws, this leaves systems less secure than they could have been. Even when mediated by careful system design, proper threat modeling, and other standard security practices, the magnitude of risk grows quickly over time, leaving vendors to do the calculus of determining how old a kernel they can tolerate exposing users to. Unless the answer is ""just abandon our users,"" engineering resources must be focused upstream on closing the gap by continuously deploying the latest kernel release.Based on our most conservative estimates, the Linux kernel and its toolchains are currently underinvested by at least 100 engineers, so it's up to everyone to bring their developer talent together upstream. This is the only solution that will ensure a balance of security at reasonable long-term cost.

These projects serve to repair, optimize and modernize infrastructures to improve services to residents and their quality of life. In a word, they’re essential.What construction work is being done in Montréal? You may be surprised to learn that the 500 projects we carry out annually represent only 25% of the work done in Montréal. The vast majority of construction works on public property are carried out by other public organizations and private companies, such as Hydro-Québec, the Commission des services électriques de Montréal, Énergir, Bell, Vidéotron, and even real estate developers. Work carried out by the city includes the following: modernization of water and sewer systems  road repair and reconstruction (re)developing streets, parks, bike paths and curb extensions updating street lighting and traffic signal systems revitalizing commercial arteries carrying out strategic projects that redefine the city.  What’s the use of all this? We have many reasons for doing all this work: Eliminating the maintenance deficit to avoid long-term impacts For many years, due to lack of budgets and because construction sites and their inconvenience were quite unpopular at the time, maintenance work on Montréal’s infrastructures was postponed, resulting in a maintenance deficit. To remedy the situation, we’ve been investing significant sums of money over the past few years to repair and rebuild infrastructure that has deteriorated over time. You could say we’re currently in a construction blitz! We need to do this work quickly to reduce the number of unplanned and urgent interventions that occur. These can have major impacts on the population, such as creating traffic congestion in key locations or reducing the available drinking water. Keeping our assets in good shape Since a pinch in time saves nine, we want to keep our existing and newly built infrastructure in good shape to make sure it will last a long time. Improving infrastructure performance  We’re improving the performance of our infrastructures to meet the needs of a growing population and improve efficiency. For example: In districts that are developing rapidly, like Griffintown in the Sud-Ouest, we’re increasing the diameter of certain water mains so they can better serve a growing population.   The addition of new pressure measurement and control chambers to the water system allows us to analyze the flow of drinking water through the distribution system in real-time and know the flow rate, volume and pressure at any moment in time. This allows us to control the water pressure in the pipes and avoid premature pipe damage.  Revitalize neighbourhoods and stimulate Montréal’s economy Certain districts and major arteries are undergoing major renewal. These strategic projects are essential to the development of the metropolis, as they constitute a unique opportunity to redefine the city of tomorrow. For example: The MIL Montréal neighbourhood, located at the junction of the boroughs of Outremont, Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, Plateau-Mont-Royal and Villeray—Saint-Michel—Parc-Extension, is currently being transformed into a real innovation district, the new home of the University of Montréal’s science complex. In order to bring this new environment to life, the city is carrying out major infrastructure work, such as construction of water and sewer lines, roadways and sidewalks, the creation of bicycle paths and the development of parks. The city is also working on certain commercial arteries to rebuild infrastructures that are obsolete or in poor condition. This work provides merchants with quality, sustainable infrastructure. We also take advantage of these projects to rethink the design of commercial streets and create attractive, safe and user-friendly arteries, which helps revitalize a neighbourhood’s economy and encourages buying local.   Did you know?

This service allowed us to have support for housework and the preparation of certain meals. I was also able to pay the travel expenses of our loved ones who came to help us. To claim the allowable amounts, I simply had to present proof of hospitalization and a certificate signed by the people who came to help us. This service was greatly appreciated to cover the unexpected costs following my hospitalization.” Mario Hospitalized 4 days following an operation “Thanks to the Assistance Program, my wife and I were able to pay the members of our family who came to help us after the birth of our son. Settlement was quick and simple.” Jeff Assistance following the childbirth of his spouse “Even if I am not covered by my spouse’s health insurance policy, our advisor explained to me that I could benefit from the Assistance Program. After having undergone an operation which required complete rest, I was then able to receive domestic help services and pay the travel expenses of my daughter who came to help us with meals every weekend.

Your shipping settings are used across Google features, including Shopping ads, free product listings, and Buy on Google. Shipping speed and cost are two of the most common reasons why customers abandon their shopping choices, so you’ll want to be sure your shipping settings are accurate and up-to-date. This article explains how the various shipping settings work and when to use them. Learn more about setting up shipping settings Note: The shipping [shipping] attribute is not available for the Buy on Google destination. For Buy on Google, the shipping price must be set up at the account level in Merchant Center. Learn more about setting up shipping for Buy on Google How it works To show your products in a particular country or region, you must offer shipping and correctly set up shipping costs for that area. Because shipping costs vary by a variety of factors, the shipping settings in Merchant Center allow you to set up shipping tables based on factors like weight, price, destination, and more. Choose the shipping options that mirror how you charge for shipping on your site. If you charge your customers exactly what you pay for shipping with common carriers, you can also select carrier rates in some countries and Google will automatically calculate the shipping cost for you. Shipping settings can also take into account product data that you submit using shipping attributes: shipping label [shipping_label], shipping weight [shipping_weight], dimensions (shipping length [shipping_length], shipping width [shipping_width], shipping height shipping_height). To further specify delivery times for certain products, you can use the transit time label [transit_time_label] attribute. The shipping costs that you submit to Merchant Center must match the costs that you charge on your website. Note: Try to exactly match the shipping costs you submit to Google and the shipping costs displayed on your website. To make sure customers don’t see a higher shipping cost on your website after clicking your Google listing, a listing might be rejected if our reviewers find a lower shipping cost on your listing than on your website. When to provide shipping settings You need to provide shipping settings in the following situations: If you want to show your products in any of the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czechia, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States. If you want to show your products in an additional country that is not a product’s primary country of sale. Learn more about submitting feeds to multiple countries What should be included in shipping Cost Shipping rate covers the shipping carrier cost as well as other costs directly related to shipping. Costs related to shipping might include handling, delivery, shipping, logistics, or carrier fees. Submit the shipping cost for a customer's location, not for a business or separate collection point. For Canada only, submit shipping cost exclusive of taxes. For Finland, Norway, and Sweden, you may alternatively submit the shipping cost to a collection point for specific carriers based on country. For Norway and Sweden: PostNord, DHL, Bring, Schenker For Finland: Posti.fi, DHL, Bring, Schenker, Matkahuolto For Argentina and Chile, you may alternatively submit the shipping cost to a collection point or a store for pickup. Shipping can include cross-border charges if the cost is included under a shipping term on your website. Shipping should also include insurance costs related to any of the terms above. If you provide shipping settings for products you sell in Australia, France, Japan, or the United States. Match availability on your landing page with the shipping information you submit to Merchant Center. If you don’t deliver your products across the entire target country, then use “No shipping” to exclude certain areas. Speed Shipping speed is an important piece of information for people evaluating a possible purchase. If you want to show this information, you can specify a handling time and transit time for your products in each of your shipping services. Handling time is the number of business days needed to process an order before it ships. It normally begins when an order is placed by a customer and ends when a carrier picks up the package for shipment. Submit this either in the shipping service or with your product data (use the maximum handling time [max_handling_time] and minimum handling time [min_handling_time] attributes). Learn more about setting up shipping speed Transit time is the number of business days it takes for a carrier to deliver a package once it's picked up from your facility. You can configure transit time options within each shipping service in your Merchant Center account. If you ship to US customers: (a) from warehouses based in the US, and use one of our select carriers to deliver your packages or (b) using one of our select partners, you can choose to let Google calculate a unique shipping speed for each customer based on their delivery location. Learn more about letting Google calculate shipping speeds Ways to set up shipping cost To get started with shipping, figure out what types of shipping cost models you need to add based on how you charge shipping. Make sure to match or overestimate the shipping costs you submit to Merchant Center in comparison to the costs you charge on your website. How you charge Shipping option Benefit Free shipping for certain ranges Fixed rate ($0 USD) Simple to configure and maintain A flat shipping rate for all orders Fixed rate Simple to configure and maintain Your shipping is based on rates from supported carriers Carrier rate along with the shipping weight and dimension attributes (available for AU, DE, and US) Rates are automatically calculated based on common carrier rates for all customers, and the rates update if the carrier rates change Based on a percentage of the order cost Percentage of order total Simple to configure and maintain and allows for varied shipping rates based on price Based on more than 2 dimensions Subtable Add additional dimensions to your shipping service Exclude a group of products from delivery in a shipping service No shipping Easily define products that you want to exclude from the shipping service Unique shipping costs for one particular product The shipping [shipping] attribute Not available for Buy on Google Allows you to manually override account settings for a product with unique shipping rates Shipping-related product data Shipping cost is often dependent on product details such as price, weight, or size. If you charge shipping based on these attributes or if you want to use carrier rates (which are calculated based on weight and size), you should add the relevant information to your product data. Product details Attribute What to add Product weight shipping weight [shipping_weight] Include a shipping weight for each product so you can vary the shipping cost based on the weight Product dimensions shipping length [shipping_length], shipping width [shipping_width], and shipping height [shipping_height] Include dimensions of a product to use for carrier rates Different shipping costs for a group of products shipping label [shipping_label] Define groups of products (for example, perishable or oversized) and then apply special shipping rates to those groups Different transit times for a group of products transit time label [transit_time_label] Specify transit times for product groups to provide greater accuracy in estimated delivery dates How more advanced shipping settings work Depending on your shipping model, you might want to learn more about one or more of the more advanced settings described here. Minimum order value If you require that customers purchase a minimum amount before you’ll provide shipping, then you can enter that information when setting up your shipping settings. Learn more about minimum order value Carrier rates (AU, DE, UK, and US only) Use this setting if you charge shipping based on a carrier-calculated rate. You can choose from supported carriers (for example, UPS, TNT, Hermes) and services (for example, Ground, Next Day Air, 3 Day Select) available. Region Supported shipping carrier Australia AusPost, TNT, TOLL France Geodis Germany DHL, DPD, Hermes, UPS United Kingdom DHL, DPD, Royal Mail, TNT, UPS, Yodel United States FedEx, UPS, USPS To use carrier rates, you’ll also need to submit shipping-related attributes (see table above): Shipping weight [shipping_weight] Shipping length [shipping_length] Shipping width [shipping_width] Shipping height [shipping_height] Learn more about setting up carrier rates Rate modifications Carrier rates use the standard commercial rates for each carrier, but you can adjust the rates (up or down) by a percentage or flat amount. Some carriers have multiple rates for commercial and personal purposes. Google uses commercial rates (for example, “Standard” for FedEx and “Daily” for UPS). If you use non-commercial shipping rates (often called retail), you’ll likely need to adjust the rates up by 50 – 60%. If you have a contract with the carrier, then you might need to adjust your rates up or down (using a negative number like -10) by a percentage or flat amount. Subtables and complex shipping models Use a subtable if your shipping is based on 3 or more dimensions. For example, use a subtable if your shipping is based on price, weight, and destination. Learn more about setting up subtables Shipping from outside the country of sale If you ship across borders, you normally incur additional costs such as customs, duties or import tax. Don't include such costs in the shipping attribute unless the shipping provider is fully responsible for the handling of goods through customs and the cost is included under a shipping term on your website. Learn more about export requirements Note: Shipping to South Korea from outside South Korea isn't permitted. No shipping Use the ""No shipping"" option to indicate that you don’t offer shipping for particular products through a shipping service. For example, if you don’t ship products over 50 lbs using your express service, use ""No shipping"" to indicate that. For products that target Argentina, Australia, Japan, or the United States, you can use ""No shipping"" to exclude shipping to certain states (AU and US), postal codes (AU and US), or prefectures (JP). For example, you can specify that you don’t ship outside of Tokyo prefecture or to a range of postal codes that represent the East Coast of the United States. For those countries, still set up shipping for the areas that you do ship to, and make sure to specify ""No shipping"" for any areas that you do not ship to. Learn more about setting up shipping settings Delivery zones (AU, FR, and US only) Delivery zones are used to create custom regions so accurate shipping costs and transit times can be set for shipments to customers in Australia, France, or the United States. For example, if you’re located on the East Coast of the United States, you may see higher costs and extended transit times when shipping orders to the West Coast. Learn more about setting up delivery zones Transit time labels If you ship differently grouped products, you can create a transit time label for each group of products and apply the transit time label [transit_time_label] attribute to the corresponding products in your feed. Transit time labels help give your customers a more accurate estimated delivery date, which can help influence their purchase decision. For example, you add transit time label heavy to items with higher shipping costs due to their weight. Learn more about transit time labels Oversize and freight shipping (LTL) Carriers have limits on how large or how heavy a package can be. Larger products are normally shipped using freight shipping. Freight carriers aren't supported by the carrier rate feature, so if your product is too big to ship through common shipping carriers, you’ll need to manually set up a rate table. Note: This only applies to Shopping ads and free listings. LTL (less than truckload) and freight shipping aren't currently allowed for Buy on Google. Here are some tips for setting up freight shipping: Tag oversized or heavy products with the shipping label attribute. With the shipping label [shipping_label] attribute, you can give oversized products a label (for example, oversized) and then specify special shipping for those products. For example, you could add a shipping label for common freight classes. Add rates based on weight and destination using tables and shipping groups. It’s easiest to split up complicated shipping settings, either by using subtables or shipping groups. Base rates on shipping labels. Using shipping labels, you can create different rate tables for different product groups by creating shipping groups. For example, you could use the shipping label [shipping_label] attribute to indicate a freight class for each product. Then create a group for each label such as one group for Class 70 and one for Class 100. Base rates on weight and location. If you don’t want to use shipping labels, you can link subtables for different weight classes with different rates for each state or group of postal codes. Overestimate the cost. If you can’t provide an accurate cost, then overestimate. Your products won’t be disapproved for providing a higher shipping cost than what your website states. If you provide a lower cost than the one listed on your website, your products will be disapproved. Learn more about setting up shipping settings Holiday shipping cut-off (available for US and France, for US holidays only) The holiday shipping cut-off setting allows you to submit temporary deadlines if you have special delivery settings for a particular holiday, like Christmas or Mother’s Day. Your items will clearly state if a purchase will be delivered in time for a holiday, based on a date and time you enter into the “Show from” field. Example: You have a requirement that your customers place their orders by December 15 at 2:00 p.m. PST to guarantee arrival by Christmas Eve (December 24). When you set this deadline in Merchant Center, text will be displayed that tells customers their order will arrive by December 24. That text will stop showing shortly after your cut-off (in this example, the text would stop displaying on December 15 after 2:00 PST). Holiday shipping cutoff will override all other estimated delivery date logic, so it's important to select a deadline that provides you enough time to guarantee delivery on all orders placed before the cutoff. If, for example, the Christmas order deadline is set for December 24, items ordered up to that day will be guaranteed to arrive by Christmas. This may require you to ship orders on weekends or upgrade the shipping speed to meet the delivery promise. If you participate in Buy on Google, and fail to meet the “ship by” or “delivery by” dates in these circumstances, your Retailer Standards score may be negatively impacted. Merchant Center is programmed to offer holiday shipping cut-offs for the following US holidays: Valentine’s Day Easter Mother’s Day Father’s Day Independence Day Halloween Thanksgiving Christmas Note: For France, holiday shipping cutoff will only be available for Valentine’s Day and Christmas.

Frequently asked questions In-person teaching Working from home Info for staff Info for managers HR & benefits Travel In-person teaching – Fall 2021 What happens if someone in my class tests positive for COVID-19? If someone in a class tests positive for COVID-19 and was on campus during the time they might have been contagious, everyone on the class list will be notified by email – regardless of whether they attended in person or not. The email will inform students of their contact risk level and provide instructions about what to do next. In most cases, because students must wear their procedure mask at all times, they will be considered a low-risk contact and will not need to self-isolate. They’ll simply need to monitor their health for symptoms. Because students may be in more than one class with the affected individual, they may receive more than one notification. Those who do not receive any email notifications are not considered to be at risk at this time. Anyone who develops symptoms should not come to campus. They must stay home and refer to Procedure for suspected or confirmed case Is Concordia equipping classrooms with microphones so students can hear faculty if they teach with their procedure masks on? The university already equips large classrooms requiring voice amplification with microphones. Voice amplification microphones are not currently available in other rooms. If faculty require additional equipment in their classroom or if they have questions, they can contact the IITS Service Desk. For urgent classroom support, instructors should contact their closest IT Service Centre.   Should faculty record their classroom lectures? Concordia is not requiring faculty to record their classroom lectures. Should a professor choose to record their lectures, the university can support them in their bimodal instruction. Faculty are encouraged to put their class materials, including their recordings where available, on Moodle. Training for Moodle and YuJa is available to all faculty and staff. Registration is available on the IT Training page. What happens in the case of an individual who tests positive for COVID-19 at Concordia? Please note: Anyone who is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms should contact Quebec Public Health (1-877-644-4545) and follow their instructions. Concordians are also required to consult the Procedure for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases and complete the Self-Isolation form in the My Account section of the Student Hub (for students) or Carrefour (for faculty and staff). In the event of a positive case at the university, Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) will work with public health authorities to conduct an investigation and to trace possible contacts. EHS will directly contact any Concordian deemed to be a contact risk. In some instances, EHS may determine during their investigation that all attendees of a class need to self-isolate. Should this occur, EHS will advise the affected students’ departments and the Office of the Provost. The departments will then inform all the students’ professors and ensure that they make necessary arrangements. What should faculty do if a student says they have developed COVID-19 symptoms on campus? If a student tells an instructor in person that they have developed COVID-19 symptoms, they should instruct the student to put on their procedure mask and exit the campus immediately. While exiting, the student must maintain two metres of physical distancing from others and refrain from touching surfaces unnecessarily. If possible, students should avoid using public transit.  Once home, the student must:  call Quebec Public Health (1-877-644-4545) and follow their instructions complete the Self-Isolation form in the My Account section of the Student Hub Instructors should also advise the student that Environmental Health and Safety will initiate a suspected COVID-19 investigation, including contact tracing, which consists of collecting information regarding individuals they encountered while on campus. Faculty can refer to the Procedure for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases for more information. What should faculty do if a student says they have developed COVID-19 symptoms off campus? If a student tells an instructor remotely that they have developed COVID-19 symptoms, they should advise the student to stay home, call Quebec Public Health (1-877-644-4545) and follow their instructions. If told to self-isolate, the student must complete the COVID-19 Self-Isolation form in the My Account section of the Student Hub. In this case, Concordia encourages faculty to make accommodations for the student regarding required assignments and in-person attendance, as well as for others who may be affected while the student is unwell. If the student was on campus 48 hours prior to developing COVID-19 symptoms, Environmental Health and Safety will contact them and conduct a suspected COVID-19 investigation. Faculty can refer to the Procedure for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases for more information. What should faculty do in the event that a student with COVID-19 symptoms requires immediate medical attention? In the event a student requires immediate medical attention and cannot leave campus on their own, instructors should call Campus Security at 514-848-3717.  Campus Security will take the necessary steps to ensure the student obtains medical assistance.  The student should be directed to an isolation room. Each unit or department at the university has an isolation room for individuals who present COVID-19 symptoms while on campus. What happens if a professor tests positive for COVID-19 during the term? If a professor tests positive for COVID-19, they must complete the COVID-19 Self-Isolation form under the My CU Account section of Carrefour.  If an instructor is unable to teach a class in person due to an illness, they can deliver their course remotely by recording their upcoming lecture. In the event a professor is too ill to record their lecture, the university will request that another instructor deliver the course in their absence. What should an instructor do if a student is not wearing a procedure mask? As more students return to campus over the fall term, there may be more instances when Concordians simply forget to put their masks on when walking around on campus. Some individuals may also be exempt from wearing a procedure mask due to medical issues. Should an instructor see someone who is not wearing a procedure mask in a shared indoor space, they should kindly remind the individual to put one on. Procedure masks help protect others from contracting COVID-19, as outlined in the “COVID Safety Pledge” that Concordians must commit to before accessing campus. If a student in a class refuses to wear a procedure mask, faculty should ask them to step out the classroom and remind them that they can pick up a free one from a campus access point. Failure to comply with COVID-19 health protocols can result in the university revoking an individual’s access-to-campus privileges. In the event that someone refuses to wear a procedure mask, please contact Campus Security at 514-848-3717 for further assistance.  What should faculty do if a student is coughing during a lecture? Because procedure masks are effective at blocking droplets and aerosols from talking, coughing and sneezing, instructors simply need to check that the student is wearing their procedure mask in accordance with mandatory health and safety directives on campus. What should an instructor do if a student does not keep two metres of physical distance when speaking to them or to other students? Individuals must only keep two metres apart when they are not wearing procedure masks. At Concordia, all members of the university community must wear procedure masks on campus when they are unable to respect two metres of physical distancing. If a student who previously had COVID-19 symptoms returns to class exhibiting the same signs of illness, what should an instructor do? Faculty should advise the student to return home, contact Quebec Public Health (1-877-644-4545) and follow their instructions. They must also complete the Self-Isolation form in the My Account section of the Student Hub. If a student is not well enough to leave on their own, instructors should contact Campus Security at 514-848-3717. Where can faculty find the COVID-19 directives applicable to their classroom? COVID-19 safety directives are posted in all classrooms. Instructors who are teaching in a classroom without a poster listing the COVID-19 safety directives should advise Environmental Health and Safety by email at ehs@concordia.ca. EHS asks that faculty include the classroom number and course they are teaching in their email.  Where are Concordia’s COVID-19 isolation rooms? Each unit or department at the university has an isolation room for individuals who present COVID-19 symptoms while on campus. Units and departments should only use isolation rooms when someone is unable to leave campus immediately. Faculty should contact their chair or director to learn the location of their department’s isolation room. Whom should faculty contact with any questions regarding health and safety protocols on campus? Instructors can send their questions about health and safety protocols to Environmental Health and Safety by email at ehs@concordia.ca. Where can faculty read the university’s Procedure for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases? Instructors can consult the procedure for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases by visiting Environmental Health and Safety’s webpage. Are there markings on classroom floors to help keep instructors and students at a two-metre distance? Some classrooms have tape on the ground to mark where faculty can keep two metres from students’ seating area. If an instructor cannot stay within that area, they must wear their procedure mask. Working from home 2021-22 transition period Concordia is taking the opportunity to use the 2021-22 academic year as a transition period to assess which initiatives to carry over from the past year, including introducing a set of remote work guidelines for the majority of Concordia staff.   At the end of the academic year, Concordia will assess and re-evaluate the situation, as well as the university’s collective experiences, to make decisions about the future of remote work. Do all faculty and staff, including teaching assistants, have access to Zoom? All employees have access to Zoom. Teaching assistants must activate their Concordia email address (firstname.lastname@concordia.ca) to gain access to the university’s Zoom license. Once activated, they can use Zoom for the duration of their contract. Will Concordia continue to offer resources on how to work from home? The university will continue to provide guidance on working from home through Learn, teach, work from home and the CU at Home website, as well as regular virtual meetings and town halls for units, supervisors and members of the administration. If an employee needs access to their computer files, how can they be accessed remotely? Concordia's Virtual Private Network (VPN) service allows staff and faculty whoare working remotely with access to services. Instructions are available on the dedicated IITS webpage. Support is also available at the IITS Help Desk (help@concordia.ca). How can employees ensure they don’t lose remote access to their office computer while working from home? To maintain access to campus files and tools through a remote desktop, it is important that faculty and staff avoid restarting, shutting down or putting to sleep their office computer. When they need to leave their remote desktop, they can safely select “disconnect.” This should ensure that their office computer remains on. As a temporary measure, to help office computers remain powered on during the COVID-19 pandemic, IITS has hidden the shutdown option on IITS-managed computers. Employees can contact the IT Service Desk if they’re having problems connecting to their office computer or maintaining a remote desktop connection. Who is available to help an employee if they lose remote access to their office computer? Faculty and staff can contact the IT Service Desk if they’re having problems connecting to their office computer or maintaining a remote desktop connection. If their office computer has been shut down or lost power, employees are asked to provide their office room number in their service request. This will allow IITS to send someone to turn it back on. Can employees get guidance on how to set up a comfortable and safe home working environment? Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) has made available information on how to work from home while minimizing the risk of injuries — particularly linked to an employee's desk and computer setup. Because some people may have specific concerns, EHS is also booking online appointments for ergonomic consultations. Concordia employees who need to speak with an EHS expert can email a request to ehs@concordia.ca. Do employees need a medical certificate if they are self-isolating? No, a medical certificate is not required. If an employee has been instructed to self-isolate by public health authorities, we also ask that they complete the Self-isolation form on Carrefour.  If employee experiences an injury while working from home for the university, do they still report the injury, and what is the process? Yes, if an employee incurs an injury while working for the university remotely they should report it to their supervisor. They should also fill in this injury form and email it to their supervisor and copy EHS at workinjury@concordia.ca. Please note: If the injury requires medical attention or lost time, a doctor’s note is required.  For additional information, faculty and staff can refer to concordia.ca/campus-life/safety/injury. Info for staff Can on-campus events take place? Space reservations resume according to the Policy on the Temporary Use of Space (VPS-24) with additional COVID safety regulations based on the Government of Quebec’s reopening plan. Employees are encouraged to find out more about what's in place for fall 2021. Do employees have to take vacation days even if they are unable to travel? Staff must use their vacation entitlement as per their union’s or association’s collective agreement or policy. Even if vacations may be different during these unusual times, it is important for Concordians to take time off to disconnect and find space to relax and recharge. What should an employee do if they would like to take part in training sessions and other online opportunities during working hours? Staff should discuss any plans with their supervisor. Where can employees find guidance and resources for keeping their work on track? Human Resources has created a guide for staff and faculty trying to adjust to new ways of working. Additional resources are also available on the Working Through Change page on Carrefour. Are employees allowed to work overtime? As per usual practice, overtime must be pre-approved by the employee's manager. Info for managers See the Return to Campus resources for managers on Carrefour Can on-campus events take place? Space reservations resume according to the Policy on the Temporary Use of Space (VPS-24) with additional COVID safety regulations based on the Government of Quebec’s reopening plan. Employees are encouraged to find out more about what's in place for fall 2021. What should I do if an employee is self-isolating due to COVID-19? If they have not already done so, instruct them to complete the self-isolation form, located on Carrefour. If they are able to work and can complete their tasks remotely, there is nothing further to be done. If they are too ill to work remotely, please contact medicalabsence@concordia.ca so that they can be placed on sick leave, according to the rules of their contract or collective agreement. If they are well enough to work but cannot perform their regular tasks remotely, please contact labour@concordia.ca What should a manager do if they see an employee who is not wearing a procedure mask in a shared indoor space on campus? As more faculty and staff return to campus over the fall term, there may be more instances when employees simply forget to put their masks on when walking around on campus. Should a manager see an employee who is not wearing a procedure mask in a shared indoor space, they should kindly remind the individual that they need to put one on. Procedure masks help protect everyone from contracting COVID-19, as outlined in the “COVID-19 Safety Pledge” that Concordians must commit to before accessing campus.  Cases of non-compliance will be addressed through the respective collective or employment agreement or policy.   In the event that an employee refuses to wear a procedure mask, managers should contact Campus Security at extension 3717 for further assistance. Should managers continue to encourage their employees to take their vacation? Yes. Even if vacations may be different during these unusual times, it is even more important for faculty and staff to take time off to disconnect and find space to relax and recharge.  Can managers ask their employee(s) to provide their vacation plans for the coming year? Yes, managers should request vacation plans from their employee(s) and schedule them as usual taking into account service requirements. All employees are entitled and encouraged to take vacation days during the pandemic. Can employees pay out their vacation days? Given that vacations provide incredible benefits for an individual’s mental health and wellness, Concordia is not providing the option for employees to monetize their vacation days.  Can employee(s) postpone or carry over their personal or family days into the next fiscal year? Employees cannot carry over personal or family days from one year to another. Collective agreements and official university policies remain in effect during the COVID-19 pandemic. What should a manager do if they have an employee who wants to change their work conditions (location, schedule, etc.) as a result of the pandemic, or because of exceptional circumstances? For any questions on changes to an employee’s work conditions, managers should contact a representative of Employee and Labour Relations. Where can managers find guidance and resources for keeping staff engaged and work on track? Human Resources has created a guide for staff and faculty trying to adjust to new ways of working, some tips and tricks for managers, and a guide to keep managers and staff fully engaged and productive while working from home. Managers who have specific questions on navigating these challenging times can also reach out to Natalie Camirand, manager of organizational development. Are there any resources for managers on holding effective online or hybrid meetings? For more information on how to hold effective online meetings, managers can refer to these tips for virtual meetings. If they have employees working remotely and on campus, Human Resources also offers strategies for hosting hybrid meetings.  For other resources to support employees through times of change, managers can visit Human Resources’ dedicated Working Through Change page on Carrefour. How can managers support a team member who feels lonely? If a manager knows that someone on their team lives alone, feels lonely or is experiencing difficulties adapting to working remotely or in a hybrid fashion, they should make sure to connect with them regularly to keep track of how they are feeling. Managers and employees are encouraged to brainstorm together and identify ideas that may help them get through this situation more easily. Managers can also suggest that staff try to maintain their relationships and support each other by keeping in contact. Everyone has a role to play in lifting their own spirits and, consequently, lifting the spirit of the community. If a manager is worried about one of their team members or colleagues, they may refer them to Concordia’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) at 1-800-663-1142 (English services) or 1-866-398-9505 (French services). They may also suggest that they visit the EAP website. All contact between Concordia employees and their EAP counsellor is confidential and at no cost.

The goal? To make sure that online course delivery was ready for students by March 23. From the time that the university closed its two campuses and libraries, there has been a flurry of activity going on behind the scenes to prepare for the first day of virtual classes. Robert Cassidy, director of the Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL), and his team have been working almost around the clock — through the adversity of their own self-isolation and with sick children and parents to care for. Together they built the workflows and protocols needed to support faculty members in the online delivery of their courses. The CTL is supporting every class at the university and also providing support to all faculty members and students. Accessibility is a major consideration for their team. If students have minimal equipment and minimal internet, there are solutions for them. For those who have visual, hearing or motor impairments, the CTL is making sure that they are equally able to learn online. ‘We were deeply touched’ Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the CTL staff have not been working alone. A group of dedicated Concordia Library team members have been collaborating with the CTL to make the transition to online courses a reality. In preparation for the major transition, the CTL developed a series of options or workflows that professors might want to use to deliver courses online without having to completely redesign their courses. Knowing that many professors would need assistance to do this, the centre was concerned they wouldn’t have the capacity to respond to anticipated requests. The Concordia community was quick to react. A simple request for help from Sandra Gabriele, vice-provost of innovation in teaching and learning, and Guylaine Beaudry, vice provost of digital strategy and university librarian, put things into motion. Beaudry, with the coordination of Dianne Cmor, associate university librarian for teaching and learning, sent an email to all of the librarians, library professionals and library systems technicians asking those who could help to attend a meeting that afternoon on March 13. When Cassidy and some of his team arrived at the library, they were welcomed by about 25 volunteers ready to lend a hand. Librarians, professionals and technicians now make up the new Online Workflow Support Team. “We were shocked — and deeply touched — to walk into a room of so many volunteers. They made four times the human resources of our unit, stepping up to help us out,” he says. From the initial briefing that Friday, during which the CTL team ran through the prescribed workflows with the library volunteers, the team got to work training themselves through the weekend. Given that all were working from home, they were also provided with a crash course on Microsoft Teams given by Paul Fournier, director of digital strategy in the Office of the Vice Provost of Digital Strategy, which allowed them to communicate and share with each other while they were learning the workflows. During this condensed learning period, the library team has had an opportunity to enhance their overall digital capabilities, as they learned to use and navigate around platforms such as Teams, Zoom, Moodle and Yuja. Cmor has been very impressed with the amount of learning and collaboration that took place. “I have been watching the team training themselves and supporting each other, and it’s been an incredible thing to witness. MS Teams has allowed everyone to learn from each other and it really demonstrates this collaboration platform at its finest.” As Cmor goes on to explain, “The goal was to learn the CTL workflow in a type of ‘just-in-time’ method. Then the librarians and library professionals could assist the faculty members on the workflow when they ran into problems, and also be a calm presence for faculty under a lot of pressure who needed a little extra support.” ‘It was incredible to see how the team members learned together’ Cassidy and Cmor worked to differentiate their support roles in terms of what was needed by faculty members. As the CTL team are the pedagogy experts, they have been handling the more specialized cases that benefit directly from their expertise. The library team have been taking care of the more general and technical cases, which has freed up a significant amount of time for CTL staff to focus on thinking strategically about putting resources into place and expanding the amount of support that can be provided. Of the approximately 25 people in the library providing this support, five are technicians. They are handling all of the IITS service desk tickets since they are very familiar with this system already. Their knowledge and expertise have been extremely helpful for sending the tickets to all of the different librarians and library professionals and ensuring that they are being distributed optimally. None of this frontline support would be possible without these technicians. For both Cassidy and Cmor, the team learning that has come out of this experience and that continues to evolve is remarkable. “It was incredible to see how the team members learned together and taught each other as they went through the workflow documentation,” Cmor notes. “The workflow training turnaround time was quick. But, more importantly, the team helped each other so that they could help faculty — which was the main objective. The librarians and library professionals have been simply amazing!” According to Cassidy, since the first day of online classes began on March 23, things have been running fairly smoothly, with few emergencies or dropped balls to contend with. This collaborative effort is a great example of the whole Concordia community working together to meet a challenge head on while providing the very best for its students. “With the library support and despite the small team in the CTL, we are really well positioned to support faculty members and students in our new digital reality,” Cassidy says.   Find out more about the Concordia Library.

",1,"Google Online Security Blog Security Blog The latest news and insights from Google on security and safety on the Internet Exploring Container Security: A Storage Vulnerability Deep Dive December 2, 2021 Posted by Fabricio Voznika and Mauricio Poppe, Google Cloud Kubernetes Security is constantly evolving - keeping pace with enhanced functionality, usability and flexibility while also balancing the security needs of a wide and diverse set of use-cases.Recently, the GKE Security team discovered a high severity vulnerability that allowed workloads to have access to parts of the host filesystem outside the mounted volumes boundaries. Although the vulnerability was patched back in September we thought it would be beneficial to write up a more in-depth analysis of the issue to share with the community.We assessed the impact of the vulnerability as described in vulnerability management in open-source Kubernetes and worked closely with the GKE Storage team and the Kubernetes Security Response Committee to find a fix. In this post we’ll give some background on how the subpath storage system works, an overview of the vulnerability, the steps to find the root cause and the fix, and finally some recommendations for GKE and Anthos users.Kubernetes Filesystems: Intro to Volume SubpathThe vulnerability, CVE-2021-25741, was caused by a race condition during the creation of a subpath bind mount inside a container, and allowed an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the underlying node filesystem and its sensitive files. We’ll describe how that system is supposed to work, and then talk about the vulnerability.The volume subpath feature in Kubernetes enables sharing a volume in multiple containers inside a pod. For example, we could create a Pod with an InitContainer that creates directories with pre-populated data in a mounted filesystem volume. These directories can then be used by containers in the same Pod by mounting the same volume and optionally specifying a subpath field to limit what's visible inside the container.While there are some great use cases for this feature, it’s an area that has had vulnerabilities discovered in the past. The kubelet must be extra cautious when handling user-owned subpaths because it operates with privileges in the host. One vulnerability that has been previously discovered involved the creation of a malicious workload where an InitContainer would create a symlink pointing to any location in the host. For example, the InitContainer could mount a volume in /mnt and create a symlink /mnt/attack inside the container pointing to /etc. Later in the Pod lifecycle, another container would attempt to mount the same volume with subpath attack. While preparing the volumes for the container, the kubelet would end up following the symlink to the host’s /etc instead of the container’s /etc, unknowingly exposing the host filesystem to the container. A previous fix made sure that the subpath mount location is resolved and validated to point to a location inside the base volume and that it's not changeable by the user in between the time the path was validated and when the container runtime bind mounts it. This race condition is known as time of check to time of use (TOCTOU) where the subject being validated changes after it has been validated.These validations and others are summarized in the following container lifecycle sequence diagram.Volume subpath validations before the container startupA New TOCTOU Vulnerability: CVE-2021-25741The latest vulnerability was discovered by performing a symlink attack similar to the one explained above, with the difference being that it constantly swapped the symlink with a directory in a tight loop, using the RENAME_EXCHANGE option with renameat(2). If the timing is just right, the kubelet will see the path as a directory and pass the validation check. Then the mount utility may find that the path is a symlink pointing to the host and follow it, exposing the host filesystem to the container. This is visualized in the following diagram:The expectation and the attack outcomeThe GKE Security and Storage teams worked closely to revise the fix done previously to find a solution. The previous fix takes several steps to ensure that the directory being mounted is safely opened and validated. After the file is opened and validated, the kubelet uses the magic-link path under /proc/[pid]/fd directory for all subsequent operations to ensure the file remains unchanged. However, we found out that all of the efforts were undone by the mount(8) linux utility which was dereferencing the procfs magic-link by default. Once the problem was understood, the fix involved making sure that the mount utility doesn't dereference the magic-links by using the --no-canonicalize flag in the mount command.The fix is inOnce the problem was well understood, we fixed it inside Kubernetes and quickly released the fix to GKE and Anthos. If GKE auto-upgrade is enabled in your clusters there's no action on your part for this vulnerability, your nodes have already been patched. We strongly recommend that customers utilize auto-upgrades. Auto-upgrade gives peace of mind that your clusters are running with the latest patches.GKE released a Google Kubernetes Engine security bulletin on this vulnerability, which detailed what customers can do to immediately remediate this issue across GKE and Anthos. We also provided guidance to customers who manually manage their node versions, ensuring that fixed releases were available in every region for our Static and Release Channels.Moving forwardGoogle continues to invest heavily in the security of GKE and Kubernetes. We encourage users interested in finding vulnerabilities to participate in the Kubernetes bug bounty program and in the Google Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) which was recently expanded to cover GKE vulnerabilities. For the latest guidance on security issues, please follow our GKE Security Bulletins.  Google ClusterFuzzLite: Continuous fuzzing for all November 11, 2021 Posted by Jonathan Metzman, Google Open Source Security TeamIn recent years, continuous fuzzing has become an essential part of the software development lifecycle. By feeding unexpected or random data into a program, fuzzing catches bugs that would otherwise slip through the most thorough manual checks and provides coverage that would take staggering human effort to replicate. NIST’s guidelines for software verification, recently released in response to the White House Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, specify fuzzing among the minimum standard requirements for code verification.Today, we are excited to announce ClusterFuzzLite, a continuous fuzzing solution that runs as part of CI/CD workflows to find vulnerabilities faster than ever before. With just a few lines of code, GitHub users can integrate ClusterFuzzLite into their workflow and fuzz pull requests to catch bugs before they are committed, enhancing the overall security of the software supply chain.Since its release in 2016, over 500 critical open source projects have integrated into Google’s OSS-Fuzz program, resulting in over 6,500 vulnerabilities and 21,000 functional bugs being fixed. ClusterFuzzLite goes hand-in-hand with OSS-Fuzz, by catching regression bugs much earlier in the development process.Large projects including systemd and curl are already using ClusterFuzzLite during code review, with positive results. According to Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, “When the human reviewers nod and have approved the code and your static code analyzers and linters can't detect any more issues, fuzzing is what takes you to the next level of code maturity and robustness. OSS-Fuzz and ClusterFuzzLite help us maintain curl as a quality project, around the clock, every day and every commit.”With the release of ClusterFuzzLite, any project can integrate this essential testing standard and benefit from fuzzing. ClusterFuzzLite offers many of the same features as ClusterFuzz, such as continuous fuzzing, sanitizer support, corpus management, and coverage report generation. Most importantly, it’s easy to set up and works with closed source projects, making ClusterFuzzLite a convenient option for any developer who wants to fuzz their software. With ClusterFuzzLite, fuzzing is no longer just an idealized ""bonus"" round of testing for those who have access to it, but a critical must-have step that everyone can use continuously on every software project. By finding and preventing bugs before they enter the codebase we can build a more secure software ecosystem. To learn more, check out the ClusterFuzzLite documentation. ClusterFuzzLite currently supports GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build and Prow. We built this with CI system extensibility in mind, and adding support for other CI systems is straightforward. Please contact us if you’re interested in contributing support, or have any questions, feedback or feature requests.  Google Trick & Treat! 🎃 Paying Leets and Sweets for Linux Kernel privescs and k8s escapes November 1, 2021 Posted by Eduardo Vela, Google Bug Hunters Team Starting today and for the next 3 months (until January 31 2022), we will pay 31,337 USD to security researchers that exploit privilege escalation in our lab environment with a patched vulnerability, and 50,337 USD to those that use a previously unpatched vulnerability, or a new exploit technique.We are constantly investing in the security of the Linux Kernel because much of the internet, and Google—from the devices in our pockets, to the services running on Kubernetes in the cloud—depend on the security of it. We research its vulnerabilities and attacks, as well as study and develop its defenses.But we know that there is more work to do. That’s why we have decided to build on top of our kCTF VRP from last year and triple our previous reward amounts (for at least the next 3 months).Our base rewards for each publicly patched vulnerability is 31,337 USD (at most one exploit per vulnerability), but the reward can go up to 50,337 USD in two cases:If the vulnerability was otherwise unpatched in the Kernel (0day)If the exploit uses a new attack or technique, as determined by GoogleWe hope the new rewards will encourage the security community to explore new Kernel exploitation techniques to achieve privilege escalation and drive quicker fixes for these vulnerabilities. It is important to note, that the easiest exploitation primitives are not available in our lab environment due to the hardening done on Container-Optimized OS. Note this program complements Android's VRP rewards, so exploits that work on Android could also be eligible for up to 250,000 USD (that's in addition to this program).The mechanics are:Connect to the kCTF VRP cluster, obtain root and read the flag (read this writeup for how it was done before, and this threat model for inspiration), and then submit your flag and a checksum of your exploit in this form.(If applicable) report vulnerabilities to upstream.We strongly recommend including a patch since that could qualify for an additional reward from our Patch Reward Program, but please report vulnerabilities upstream promptly once you confirm they are exploitable.Report your finding to Google VRP once all patches are publicly available (we don't want to receive details of unpatched vulnerabilities ahead of the public.)Provide the exploit code and the algorithm used to calculate the hash checksum.A rough description of the exploit strategy is welcome.Reports will be triaged on a weekly basis. If anyone has problems with the lab environment (if it's unavailable, technical issues or other questions), contact us on Discord in #kctf. You can read more details about the program here. Happy hunting!  Google Protecting your device information with Private Set Membership October 28, 2021 Posted by Kevin Yeo and Sarvar Patel, Private Computing Team At Google, keeping you safe online is our top priority, so we continuously build the most advanced privacy-preserving technologies into our products. Over the past few years, we've utilized innovations in cryptographic research to keep your personal information private by design and secure by default. As part of this, we launched Password Checkup, which protects account credentials by notifying you if an entered username and password are known to have been compromised in a prior data breach. Using cryptographic techniques, Password Checkup can do this without revealing your credentials to anyone, including Google. Today, Password Checkup protects users across many platforms including Android, Chrome and Google Password Manager.Another example is Private Join and Compute, an open source protocol which enables organizations to work together and draw insights from confidential data sets. Two parties are able to encrypt their data sets, join them, and compute statistics over the joint data. By leveraging secure multi-party computation, Private Join and Compute is designed to ensure that the plaintext data sets are concealed from all parties.In this post, we introduce the next iteration of our research, Private Set Membership, as well as its open-source availability. At a high level, Private Set Membership considers the scenario in which Google holds a database of items, and user devices need to contact Google to check whether a specific item is found in the database. As an example, users may want to check membership of a computer program on a block list consisting of known malicious software before executing the program. Often, the set’s contents and the queried items are sensitive, so we designed Private Set Membership to perform this task while preserving the privacy of our users. Protecting your device information during enrollmentBeginning in Chrome 94, Private Set Membership will enable Chrome OS devices to complete the enrollment process in a privacy-preserving manner. Device enrollment is an integral part of the out-of-box experience that welcomes you when getting started with a Chrome OS device. The device enrollment process requires checking membership of device information in encrypted Google databases, including checking if a device is enterprise enrolled or determining if a device was pre-packaged with a license. The correct end state of your Chrome OS device is determined using the results of these membership checks.During the enrollment process, we protect your Chrome OS devices by ensuring no information ever leaves the device that may be decrypted by anyone else when using Private Set Membership. Google will never learn any device information and devices will not learn any unnecessary information about other devices. ​​To our knowledge, this is the first instance of advanced cryptographic tools being leveraged to protect device information during the enrollment process.A deeper look at Private Set MembershipPrivate Set Membership is built upon two cryptographic tools:Homomorphic encryption is a powerful cryptographic tool that enables computation over encrypted data without the need for decryption. As an example, given the encryptions of values X and Y, homomorphic encryption enables computing the encryption of the sum of X and Y without ever needing to decrypt. This preserves privacy as the data remains concealed during the computation. Private Set Membership is built upon Google’s open source homomorphic encryption library.Oblivious hashing is a cryptographic technique that enables two parties to jointly compute a hash, H(K, x), where the sender holds the key, K, and the receiver holds the hash input, x. The receiver will obtain the hash, H(K, x), without learning the key K. At the same time, the input x will be hidden from the sender.Take a look at how Private Set Membership utilizes homomorphic encryption and oblivious hashing to protect data below:For a deeper look into the technology behind Private Set Membership, you can also access our open source code.Privacy propertiesBy using Private Set Membership, the following privacy properties are obtained:No data leaves the device when checking membership. We designed Private Set Membership using advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure that data never leaves the device in an unencrypted manner when performing membership checks. As a result, the data on your device will be concealed from everyone, including Google.Devices learn only membership information and nothing else. Private Set Membership was designed to prevent devices from learning any unnecessary information about other devices when querying. For each query, devices learn only the results of the membership check and no other information.Using Private Set Membership to solve more problemsPrivate Set Membership is a powerful tool that solves a fundamental problem in a privacy-preserving manner. This is just the beginning of what’s possible using this technology. Private Set Membership can help preserve user privacy across a wide array of applications. For example:Checking allow or block lists. In this setting, users check membership in an allow or block list to determine whether to proceed with the desired action. Private Set Membership enables this check without any information about the software leaving the device.Control flows with conditional membership checks. Control flows are a common computer science concept that represent arbitrary computer programs with conditional branching. In many cases, the conditional branches require checking membership of sensitive data to determine the next step of the algorithm. By utilizing Private Set Membership, we enable execution of these algorithms while ensuring data never leaves the user’s device.We still have a ways to go before Private Set Membership is used for general membership checks by devices. At Google, we are exploring a number of potential use cases to protect your privacy using Private Set Membership. We are excited to continue advancing the state-of-the-art cryptographic research to keep you safe.AcknowledgementsThe work in this post is the result of a collaboration between a large group of current and former Google engineers, research scientists and others including: Amr Aboelkher, Asra Ali, Ghous Amjad, Yves Arrouye, Roland Bock, Xi Chen, Maksim Ivanov, Dennis Kalinichenko, Nirdhar Khazanie, Dawon Lee, Tancrède Lepoint, Lawrence Lui, Pavol Marko, Thiemo Nagel, Mariana Raykova, Aaron Segal, Joon Young Seo, Karn Seth, and Jason Wong.  Google Pixel 6: Setting a new standard for mobile security October 27, 2021 Posted by Dave Kleidermacher, Jesse Seed, Brandon Barbello, and Stephan Somogyi, Android, Pixel & Tensor security teams With Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, we’re launching our most secure Pixel phone yet, with 5 years of security updates and the most layers of hardware security. These new Pixel smartphones take a layered security approach, with innovations spanning across the Google Tensor system on a chip (SoC) hardware to new Pixel-first features in the Android operating system, making it the first Pixel phone with Google security from the silicon all the way to the data center. Multiple dedicated security teams have also worked to ensure that Pixel’s security is provable through transparency and external validation. Secure to the Core Google has put user data protection and transparency at the forefront of hardware security with Google Tensor. Google Tensor’s main processors are Arm-based and utilize TrustZone™ technology. TrustZone is a key part of our security architecture for general secure processing, but the security improvements included in Google Tensor go beyond TrustZone. Figure 1. Pixel Secure EnvironmentsThe Google Tensor security core is a custom designed security subsystem dedicated to the preservation of user privacy. It's distinct from the application processor, not only logically, but physically, and consists of a dedicated CPU, ROM, one-time-programmable (OTP) memory, crypto engine, internal SRAM, and protected DRAM. For Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, the security core’s primary use cases include protecting user data keys at runtime, hardening secure boot, and interfacing with Titan M2TM. Your secure hardware is only as good as your secure OS, and we are using Trusty, our open source trusted execution environment. Trusty OS is the secure OS used both in TrustZone and the Google Tensor security core. With Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro your security is enhanced by the new Titan M2TM, our discrete security chip, fully designed and developed by Google. In this next generation chip, we moved to an in-house designed RISC-V processor, with extra speed and memory, and made it even more resilient to advanced attacks. Titan M2TM has been tested against the most rigorous standard for vulnerability assessment, AVA_VAN.5, by an independent, accredited evaluation lab. Titan M2™ supports Android Strongbox, which securely generates and stores keys used to protect your PINs and password, and works hand-in-hand with Google Tensor security core to protect user data keys while in use in the SoC. Moving a step higher in the system, Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro ship with Android 12 and a slew of Pixel-first and Pixel-exclusive features. Enhanced Controls We aim to give users better ways to control their data and manage their devices with every release of Android. Starting with Android 12 on Pixel, you can use the new Security hub to manage all your security settings in one place. It helps protect your phone, apps, Google Account, and passwords by giving you a central view of your device’s current configuration. Security hub also provides recommendations to improve your security, helping you decide what settings best meet your needs. For privacy, we are launching Privacy Dashboard, which will give you a simple and clear timeline view of the apps that have accessed your location, microphone and camera in the last 24 hours. If you notice apps that are accessing more data than you expected, the dashboard provides a path to controls to change those permissions on the fly. To provide additional transparency, new indicators in Pixel’s status bar will show you when your camera and mic are being accessed by apps. If you want to disable that access, new privacy toggles give you the ability to turn off camera or microphone access across apps on your phone with a single tap, at any time. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro also include a toggle that lets you remove your device’s ability to connect to less-secure 2G networks. While necessary in certain situations, accessing 2G networks can open up additional attack vectors; this toggle helps users mitigate those risks when 2G connectivity isn’t needed. Built-in security By making all of our products secure by default, Google keeps more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, we’re also ratcheting up the dial on default, built-in protections. Our new optical under-display fingerprint sensor ensures that your biometric information is secure and never leaves your device. As part of our ongoing security development lifecycle, Pixel 6 and 6 Pro’s fingerprint unlock has been externally validated by security experts as a strong and secure biometric unlock mechanism meeting the Class 3 strength requirements defined in the Android 12 Compatibility Definition Document (CDD). Phishing continues to be a huge attack vector, affecting everyone across different devices. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro introduce new anti-phishing protections. Built-in protections automatically scan for potential threats from phone calls, text messages, emails, and links sent through apps, notifying you if there’s a potential problem. Users are also now better protected against bad apps by enhancements to our on-device detection capabilities within Google Play Protect. Since its launch in 2017, Google Play Protect has provided the ability to detect malicious applications even when the device is offline. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro uses new machine learning models that improve the detection of malware in Google Play Protect. The detection runs on your Pixel, and uses a privacy preserving technology called federated analytics to discover commonly-run bad apps. This will help to further protect over 3 billion users by improving Google Play Protect, which already analyzes over 100 billion apps every day to detect threats. Many of Pixel’s privacy-preserving features run inside Private Compute Core, an open source sandbox isolated from the rest of the operating system and apps. Our open source Private Compute Services manages network communication for these features, and uses federated learning, federated analytics, and private information retrieval to improve features while preserving privacy. Some features already running on Private Compute Core include Live Caption, Now Playing, and Smart Reply suggestions. Google Binary Transparency (GBT) is the newest addition to our open and verifiable security infrastructure, providing a new layer of software integrity for your device. Building on the principles pioneered by Certificate Transparency, GBT helps ensure your Pixel is only running verified OS software. It works by using append-only logs to store signed hashes of the system images. The logs are public and can be used to verify that what’s published is the same as what’s on the device – giving users and researchers the ability to independently verify OS integrity for the first time. Beyond the Phone Defense-in-depth isn’t just a matter of hardware and software layers. Security is a rigorous process. Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro benefit from in-depth design and architecture reviews, memory-safe rewrites to security critical code, static analysis, formal verification of source code, fuzzing of critical components, and red-teaming, including with external security labs to pen-test our devices. Pixel is also part of the Android Vulnerability Rewards Program, which paid out $1.75 million last year, creating a valuable feedback loop between us and the security research community and, most importantly, helping us keep our users safe. Capping off this combined hardware and software security system, is the Titan Backup Architecture, which gives your Pixel a secure foot in the cloud. Launched in 2018, the combination of Android’s Backup Service and Google Cloud’s Titan Technology means that backed-up application data can only be decrypted by a randomly generated key that isn't known to anyone besides the client, including Google. This end-to-end service was independently audited by a third party security lab to ensure no one can access a user's backed-up application data without specifically knowing their passcode. To top it all off, this end-to-end security from the hardware across the software to the data center comes with no fewer than 5 years of guaranteed Android security updates on Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro devices from the date they launch in the US. This is an important commitment for the industry, and we hope that other smartphone manufacturers broaden this trend. Together, our secure chipset, software and processes make Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro the most secure Pixel phone yet.  Google Labels: android , android security , pixel , tensor , Titan M2 Launching a collaborative minimum security baseline October 27, 2021 Posted by Royal Hansen, Vice President, Security According to an Opus and Ponemon Institute study, 59% of companies have experienced a data breach caused by one of their vendors or third parties. Outsourcing operations to third-party vendors has become a popular business strategy as it allows organizations to save money and increase operational efficiency. While these are positives for business operations, they do create significant security risks. These vendors have access to critical systems and customer data and so their security posture becomes equally as important.Up until today, organizations of all sizes have had to design and implement their own security baselines for vendors that align with their risk posture. Unfortunately, this creates an impossible situation for vendors and organizations alike as they try to accommodate thousands of different requirements.To solve this challenge, organizations across the industry teamed up to design Minimum Viable Secure Product or MVSP – a vendor-neutral security baseline that is designed to eliminate overhead, complexity and confusion during the procurement, RFP and vendor security assessment process by establishing minimum acceptable security baselines. With MVSP, the industry can increase clarity during each phase so parties on both sides of the equation can achieve their goals, and reduce the onboarding and sales cycle by weeks or even months.MVSP was developed and is backed by companies across the industry, including Google, Salesforce, Okta, Slack and more. Our goal is to increase the minimum bar for security across the industry while simplifying the vetting process.MVSP is a collaborative baseline focused on developing a set of minimum security requirements for business-to-business software and business process outsourcing suppliers. Designed with simplicity in mind, it contains only those controls that must, at a minimum, be implemented to ensure a reasonable security posture. MVSP is presented in the form of a minimum baseline checklist that can be used to verify the security posture of a solution.How can MVSP help you?Security teams measuring vendor offerings against a set of minimum security baselinesMVSP ensures that vendor selection and RFP include a minimum baseline that is backed by the industry. Communicating minimum requirements up front ensures everyone understands where they stand and that the expectations are clear.Internal teams looking to measure your security against minimum requirementsMVSP provides a set of minimum security baselines that can be used as a checklist to understand gaps in the security of a product or service. This can be used to highlight opportunities for improvement and raise their visibility within the organization, with clearly defined benefits.Procurement teams gathering information about vendor servicesMVSP provides a single set of security-relevant questions that are publicly available and industry-backed. Aligning on a single set of baselines allows clearer understanding from vendors, resulting in a quicker and more accurate response.Legal teams negotiating contractual controlsMVSP ensures expectations regarding minimum security controls are understood up front, reducing discussions of controls at the contract negotiation stage. Referencing an external baseline helps to simplify contract language and increases familiarity with the requirements.Compliance teams documenting processesMVSP provides an externally recognized and adopted set of security baselines on top of which to build your compliance efforts.We welcome community feedback and interest from other organizations who want to contribute to the MVSP baseline. Together we can raise the minimum bar for security across the industry and make everyone safer.AcknowledgementsThe work in this post is the result of a collaboration between a large number of security practitioners across the industry including: Marat Vyshegorodtsev, Chris John Riley, Gabor Acs-Kurucz, Sebastian Oglaza, Gen Buckley, and Kevin Clark.  Google Google Protects Your Accounts – Even When You No Longer Use Them October 5, 2021 Posted by Sam Heft-Luthy, Product Manager, Privacy & Data Protection Office What happens to our digital accounts when we stop using them? It’s a question we should all ask ourselves, because when we are no longer keeping tabs on what’s happening with old accounts, they can become targets for cybercrime.In fact, quite a few recent high-profile breaches targeted inactive accounts. The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack came through an inactive account that didn’t use multifactor authentication, according to a consultant who investigated the incident. And in the case of the recent T-Mobile breach this summer, information from inactive prepaid accounts was accessed through old billing files. Inactive accounts can pose a serious security risk.For Google users, Inactive Account Manager helps with that problem. You can decide when Google should consider your account inactive and whether Google should delete your data or share it with a trusted contact. Here’s How it WorksOnce you sign up for Inactive Account Manager, available in My Account settings, you are asked to decide three things:When the account should be considered inactive: You can choose 3, 6, 12 or 18 months of inactivity before Google takes action on your account. Google will notify you a month before the designated time via a message sent to your phone and an email sent to the address you provide.Who to notify and what to share: You can choose up to 10 people for Google to notify once your Google Account becomes inactive (they won’t be notified during setup). You can also give them access to some of your data. If you choose to share data with your trusted contacts, the email will include a list of the selected data you wanted to share with them, and a link they can follow to download that data. This can include things like photos, contacts, emails, documents and other data that you specifically choose to share with your trusted contact. You can also choose to set up a Gmail AutoReply, with a custom subject and message explaining that you’ve ceased using the account.If your inactive Google Account should be deleted: After your account becomes inactive, Google can delete all its content or send it to your designated contacts. If you’ve decided to allow someone to download your content, they’ll be able to do so for 3 months before it gets deleted. If you choose to delete your Google Account, this will include your publicly shared data (for example, your YouTube videos, or blogs on Blogger). You can review the data associated with your account on the Google Dashboard. If you use Gmail with your account, you'll no longer be able to access that email once your account becomes inactive. You'll also be unable to reuse that Gmail username.Setting up an Inactive Account plan is a simple step you can take to protect your data, secure your account in case it becomes inactive, and ensure that your digital legacy is shared with your trusted contacts in case you become unable to access your account. Our Privacy Checkup now reminds you to set up a plan for your account, and we’ll send you an occasional reminder about your plan via email.At Google, we are constantly working to keep you safer online. This October, as we celebrate Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we want to remind our users of the security and privacy controls they have at their fingertips.

Today, we are excited to announce our sponsorship for the Secure Open Source (SOS) pilot program run by the Linux Foundation. This program financially rewards developers for enhancing the security of critical open source projects that we all depend on. We are starting with a $1 million investment and plan to expand the scope of the program based on community feedback.Why SOS?SOS rewards a very broad range of improvements that proactively harden critical open source projects and supporting infrastructure against application and supply chain attacks. To complement existing programs that reward vulnerability management, SOS’s scope is comparatively wider in the type of work it rewards, in order to support project developers.What projects are in scope?Since there is no one definition of what makes an open source project critical, our selection process will be holistic. During submission evaluation we will consider the guidelines established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s definition in response to the recent Executive Order on Cybersecurity along with criteria listed below:The impact of the project:How many and what types of users will be affected by the security improvements?Will the improvements have a significant impact on infrastructure and user security?If the project were compromised, how serious or wide-reaching would the implications be?The project’s rankings in existing open source criticality research:Is the project included in the Havard 2 Census Study of most-used packages, or does it have a score of 0.6 or above in the OpenSSF Critically Score project?What security improvements qualify? The program is initially focused on rewarding the following work:Software supply chain security improvements including hardening CI/CD pipelines and distribution infrastructure. The SLSA framework suggests specific requirements to consider, such as basic provenance generation and verification.Adoption of software artifact signing and verification. One option to consider is Sigstore's set of utilities (e.g. cosign).Project improvements that produce higher OpenSSF Scorecard results. For example, a contributor can follow remediation suggestions for the following Scorecard checks:Code-ReviewBranch-ProtectionPinned-DependenciesDependency-Update-ToolFuzzingUse of OpenSSF Allstar and remediation of discovered issues.Earning a CII Best Practice Badge (which also improves the Scorecard results).We'll continue adding to the above list, so check our FAQ for updates. You may also submit improvements not listed above, if you provide justification and evidence to help us understand the complexity and impact of the work.Only work completed after October 1, 2021 qualifies for SOS rewards.Upfront funding is available on a limited case by case basis for impactful improvements of moderate to high complexity over a longer time span. Such requests should explain why funding is required upfront and provide a detailed plan of how the improvements will be landed.How to participateReview our FAQ and fill out this form to submit your application.Please include as much data or supporting evidence as possible to help us evaluate the significance of the project and your improvements. Reward amountsReward amounts are determined based on complexity and impact of work:$10,000 or more for complicated, high-impact and lasting improvements that almost certainly prevent major vulnerabilities in the affected code or supporting infrastructure.$5,000-$10,000 for moderately complex improvements that offer compelling security benefits.$1,000-$5,000 for submissions of modest complexity and impact.$505 for small improvements that nevertheless have merit from a security standpoint.Looking AheadThe SOS program is part of a broader effort to address a growing truth: the world relies on open source software, but widespread support and financial contributions are necessary to keep that software safe and secure. This $1 million investment is just the beginning—we envision the SOS pilot program as the starting point for future efforts that will hopefully bring together other large organizations and turn it into a sustainable, long-term initiative under the OpenSSF. We welcome community feedback and interest from others who want to contribute to the SOS program. Together we can pool our support to give back to the open source community that makes the modern internet possible.  Google Labels: Open Source , Security , supply chain Announcing New Patch Reward Program for Tsunami Security Scanner September 28, 2021 Posted by Guoli Ma, Sebastian Lekies & Claudio Criscione, Google Vulnerability Management TeamOne year ago, we published the Tsunami security scanner with the goal of detecting high severity, actively exploited vulnerabilities with high confidence. In the last several months, the Tsunami scanner team has been working closely with our vulnerability rewards program, Bug Hunters, to further improve Tsunami's security detection capabilities.Today, we are announcing a new experimental Patch Reward Program for the Tsunami project. Participants in the program will receive patch rewards for providing novel Tsunami detection plugins and web application fingerprints. We hope this program will allow us to quickly extend the detection capabilities of the scanner to better benefit our users and uncover more vulnerabilities in their network infrastructure.For this launch, we will accept two types of contributions:Vulnerability detection plugins: In order to expand Tsunami scanner's detection capabilities, we encourage everyone who is interested in making contributions to this project to add new vulnerabilities detection plugins. All plugin contributions will be reviewed by our panel members in Google's Vulnerability Management team and the reward amount will be determined by the severity as well as the time sensitivity of the vulnerability.Web application fingerprints: Several months ago, we added new web application fingerprinting capabilities to Tsunami that detect popular off-the-shelf web applications. It achieves this goal by matching application fingerprints against a database of known web application fingerprints. More fingerprint data is needed for this approach to support more web applications. You will be rewarded with a flat amount for each application added to the database.As with other Security Reward Programs, rewards can be donated to charity—and we'll double your donation if you choose to do so. We'll run this program in iterations so that everyone interested has the opportunity to participate.To learn more about this program, please check out our official rules and guidelines. And if you have any questions or suggestions for the program, feel free to contact us at tsunami-patch-rewards@google.com.  Google Distroless Builds Are Now SLSA 2 September 22, 2021 Posted by Priya Wadhwa and Appu Goundan, Google Open Source Security TeamA few months ago we announced that we started signing all distroless images with cosign, which allows users to verify that they have the correct image before starting the build process. Signing our images was our first step towards fully securing the distroless supply chain. Since then, we’ve implemented even more accountability in our supply chain and are excited to announce that distroless builds have achieved SLSA 2. SLSA is a security framework for increasing supply chain security, and Level 2 ensures that the build service is tamper resistant.This means that in addition to a signature, each distroless image now has an associated signed provenance. This provenance is an in-toto attestation and includes information around how each image was built, what command was run, and what build system was used. It also includes any special parameters that were passed in, the exact commit the images were built at, and more. This provenance is a useful tool for builds that need to be audited in the future.SLSA 2 RequirementDistrolessSource - Version controlledSource code in GithubBuild - Scripted buildBuild script exists as a Tekton Pipeline, invoked as a Google Cloud Build stepBuild - Build serviceAll steps run on Kubernetes with TektonProvenance - AvailableProvenance is available in the rekor transparency log as an in-toto attestationProvenance - AuthenticatedProvenance is signed with the distroless GCP KMS keyProvenance - Service generatedProvenance is generated by Tekton Chains from a Tekton TaskRunAchieving SLSA 2 required some changes to the distroless build pipeline: we set up Tekton Pipelines and Tekton Chains in a GKE cluster to automate building images and generating provenance. Every time a pull request is merged to the distroless Github repo, a Tekton Pipeline is triggered. This Pipeline builds the distroless images, and Tekton Chains is responsible for generating signed provenance for each image. Tekton Chains stores the signed provenance alongside the image in an OCI registry and also stores a record of the provenance in the rekor transparency log.Don't trust us? You can try the build yourself. Because distroless builds are reproducible, all the information to replicate the build is in the provenance, and you or a trusted third party can build the image yourselves and verify the build is correct by matching image digests.You can verify an attestation for a distroless image with cosign and the distroless public key:$ cosign verify-attestation -key cosign.pub gcr.io/distroless/base@sha256:4f8aa0aba190e375a5a53bb71a303c89d9734c817714aeaca9bb23b82135ed91Verification for gcr.io/distroless/base@sha256:4f8aa0aba190e375a5a53bb71a303c89d9734c817714aeaca9bb23b82135ed91 --The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:  - The cosign claims were validated  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key  - Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots....And you can find the provenance for the image in the rekor transparency log with the rekor-cli tool. For example, you could find the provenance for the above image by using the image’s digest and running:$ rekor-cli search --sha

For this reason we don’t allow the following: Promotions that prompt users to initiate a purchase, download, or other commitment without first providing all relevant information and obtaining the user’s explicit consent Promotions that represent you or your products in a way that is not accurate, realistic, and truthful Examples of what's not allowed   Omission of relevant information Failure to clearly and conspicuously disclose the payment model and full expense that a user will bear before and after purchase Examples: Pricing of products (total price, currency) may depend on additional conditions impacting the total cost for the user i.e. auction pricing, membership fees, contract, payment schemes, additional purchase requirement, creating additional undisclosed payment obligations during payment processing See the feed specification attributes on availability, price, tax and shipping for specific guidelines to comply with this policy Failure to clearly and conspicuously disclose all related conditions before and after purchase Examples: Missing merchant terms and conditions or shipping information. Return and refund policy that is unclear, missing, or not easily discoverable. Omitting material information when promoting content as benefiting a charitable or political organization Examples: Failing to display a charity or tax exemption number for charitable donations; failing to disclose whether political donations are tax exempt or not Unavailable promotions Promising products or promotional offers that aren’t available for users Examples: Promoting products that are not stocked, promoting a deal that is no longer active, call-to-action in promotion that isn't easily achievable from the landing page See the feed specification attributes on availability and price for specific guidelines to comply with this policy Misleading or unrealistic promotions Making false statements about your identity, qualifications, or the promoted product Examples: Claiming to be a certified reseller of goods when not actually certified, using a brand name to drive traffic to a different product on the site Using false claims or claims that entice the user with an improbable result (even if this result is possible) as the likely outcome that a user can expect Examples: ‘Miracle cures’ for medical ailments; extreme weight loss products Falsely implying affiliation with, or endorsement by, another individual, organization, product, or service Examples: Misleading use or mimicry of official government sites, stamps, seals, or agency names Listings promoting harmful health claims, or content that relates to a current, major health crisis and contradicts authoritative scientific consensus Examples (non-exhaustive): Anti-vaccine advocacy; denial of the existence of medical conditions such as AIDS or Covid-19; gay conversion therapy Making claims that are demonstrably false and could significantly undermine participation or trust in an electoral or democratic process Examples (non-exhaustive): Information about public voting procedures, political candidate eligibility based on age or birthplace, election results, incorrect claims that a public figure has died, or been involved in an accident  Content or claims that contradict authoritative scientific consensus on climate change  Unacceptable business practices Concealing or misstating information about the business or product Note that we may review information from multiple sources, including promotion, website, accounts, and 3rd-party sources, in determining whether a merchant or site is untrustworthy Examples: Enticing users to part with money or information under false or unclear pretenses; presenting a false identity, business name, or contact information; charging users for products typically available for free; sites that are ‘phishing’ for users information Scamming users by concealing or misstating information about the merchant’s business, or product, or service Examples: Impersonating brands or businesses by referencing or modifying the brand content in the ads, URL, destinations or misrepresenting yourself as the brand or business in user interactions Examples: Enticing users to part with money or information through a fictitious business that lacks the qualifications or capacity to provide the advertised products  Offer destinations that use “phishing” techniques to gather user information Examples: Sites that trick users into revealing their personal information by mimicking a trusted retailer We may take action on your account based on, for example, adverse regulatory warnings, settlements or rulings about a merchant’s business practices, or direct complaints from businesses and other entities about impersonation. We take violations of this policy very seriously and consider them egregious. An egregious violation of our Shopping ads policies is a violation so serious that it is unlawful or poses significant harm to our users. In determining whether a merchant or destination is violating this policy, we may review information from multiple sources including your product, website, accounts, and third-party sources. If we find violations of this policy, we will suspend your Merchant Center account upon detection and without prior warning, and you will not be allowed to participate in Shopping ads and free listings again. If you believe there's been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policy, you can submit an appeal and explain why (using the link at the bottom of this page). We only reinstate accounts in compelling circumstances, and when there is good reason, so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest. Learn more about suspended accounts What you can do Here's more about what you can do if your item is disapproved or if your Merchant Center account is warned or suspended: Omission of relevant information Here's more detail about each violation, and what you can do if your item is disapproved or if your Merchant Center account is warned or suspended: Read the policy above to learn what we don't allow. Here are some examples: Insufficient contact information: Customers need to be able to find out how to contact you on your website in at least one way. Examples include, but are not limited to, a contact us form, a link to your business profile on social media, an email address or phone number. Unsupported payment methods: Make sure that at least one conventional payment method is available to users during checkout. Examples of some conventional payment methods are credit card, debit card, invoicing, and payment on delivery. Missing refund policy: Make sure to include a return and refund policy which clearly states how you handle these actions, including all requirements and any timelines. If returns and refunds are not accepted, you’ll need to clearly state this on your site. Change your website: If your ad leads to content that violates this policy, fix the site to make it comply Request a review of your account. If your account is still within the warning period, it will automatically be reviewed again at the end of the warning period. Once the violating items are removed, you don't need to request an account review or take any additional action. If your account is suspended, you’ll need to request an account review. Request a review Most accounts are reviewed within 3 business days, but some can take longer if they need a more complex review. If we find that you've removed the violating items from your product data, we’ll remove the warning, or, in the case of account suspension, we'll approve your account to start running. Misleading or unrealistic promotions Item disapproval Items that don't comply with this policy may be disapproved. When an item is disapproved, it won't be eligible to serve. If the item doesn't comply with Shopping ads policies, it should be removed from your product data. In some instances, you’ll see the option to request a review of an item that has been disapproved for policy violations. If you believe that your item was incorrectly disapproved and would like to request a manual review, click ""Why is this item disapproved"" from the individual item page in the Products tab to initiate a review. Learn more about item disapprovals for policy violations and requesting a review Account disapproval For most violations, we'll send you a warning email detailing the policy violation and give you 7 calendar days to update your product data. Read the policy above to learn what we don't allow. Here are some you can do: Remove misleading or exaggerated claims from your website, including scientifically improbable claims that are unlikely to deliver on their promise (such as cures for incurable ailments). If you guarantee certain results, have a clear and easily accessible refund (money-back) policy. If you show testimonials that claim specific results, include a visible disclaimer stating that there's no guarantee of specific results and that the results can vary. Include links to third-party verification and/or include relevant and noticeable disclaimers when testimonials and endorsements imply that results are typical. Make sure that your promotions aren’t misleading or tricking the user into interacting with them. Remove the violating items from your product data. You’ll receive an email with details about the violation, including examples from your product data. If you have additional items in your data that violate the same policy but aren't included in the email, you'll need to remove those too. Update your product data in Merchant Center. If you created a schedule for automatic uploads, update your product data manually or wait for your product data to be automatically updated before requesting a review. Product data that you’ve uploaded as a test won’t go live and isn’t considered during account reviews. Request a review of your account.

To ensure a safe and positive experience for customers, Google requires that retailers comply with all applicable laws and regulations in addition to Shopping ads policies. It is important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the place where your business operates, as well as any other places Shopping ads and free listings are shown. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may ban you from promoting Shopping ads content with us.

Last updated: November 1, 2021, 8:57 a.m. Quebec’s vaccine passport is in effect. It limits access to certain non-essential services to those who can show Quebec-issued proof of COVID-19 vaccination.  Proof of vaccination Those with a smartphone should download the necessary app as soon as possible. Individuals who do not have a smartphone should print a paper proof of vaccination (QR code) to present as required. You can have your QR code printed and laminated at the Print Store for $2.99 +tax. For vaccinations outside of Quebec and Canada: find out what's required before travelling. Learn more about vaccine verification at university events. If you were vaccinated outside Quebec, you can get your vaccine registered with the Quebec Vaccine Registry to start using the vaccine passport. How can I get the COVID-19 vaccine? The Quebec COVID-19 vaccination program is currently underway.  Check your eligibility and schedule your appointment by visiting clicsante.ca. How can I use the vaccine passport if I got vaccinated outside Quebec? We encourage you to go to a public vaccination clinic like the Décarie Square Vaccination Clinic (6900 Décarie Boulevard) to register your vaccine with the Quebec Vaccination Registry. You don't need an appointment, but you can book one at clicsante.ca. Choose COVID-19 vaccine troubleshooting. Bring these documents with you: Hard-copy proof of your vaccine(s) administered outside Quebec Government-issued identification (e.g. passport or study permit) You'll need to know your Montreal address (proof not required). It may take a few hours to get your QR code so you can start using the VaxiCode app. Where will I need to show proof of vaccination on campus? The government requires a vaccine passport for activities and in locations not directly linked to the university’s academic, research and institutional work. Examples include:  Seated dining spaces, including bars, fast food locations and residence cafeterias;  Sports, recreational activities and related events;  Outdoor events and gatherings of more than 50 people;  Social events like “frosh” activities, student clubs, department or unit social gatherings, or others activities where attendance is not required for work or credit; and  Cinemas, performing arts venues and the chapel (unless used for activities where no vaccine passport is required).  Get a laminated card of your vaccination code from the Print Store for only $2.99 +tax. What Concordia activities and spaces will NOT require the vaccination passport?  Classes, labs, studios or other course-related places and activities;  University business, including department meetings, training sessions and other activities essential to teaching, research and administration;   Art galleries; and  Libraries.  I’m organizing an event or overseeing a space that isn’t officially part of academic, research and institutional work. Do I need to check the vaccination status of people? According to government guidelines you do. Learn more about vaccine verification. Representatives of a unit, department, student group or event are expected to check that participants have a Quebec-certified vaccine passport. VaxiCode is the free application for download deployed by the government which allows people to verify the vaccination status of customers and event participants.  Will Concordia have a COVID-19 testing centre on campus? The university will continue to work closely with public health authorities and comply fully with all health guidelines. The current protocol limits testing to those government-designated centres listed on Montreal’s public health website. If public health authorities ask universities to open additional testing clinics on their campuses, Concordia will certainly assess whether this is feasible. What will the university do to help students who are concerned about their health and to get vaccinated? Concordia’s return to campus is being planned with strict adherence to Quebec’s public health guidelines. When on campus, students will have access to many health and wellness resources. Anyone aged 12 and older age is eligible to be vaccinated for free in Quebec. Questions? Please visit the Government of Quebec site. Do I need a vaccination passport if I am living in Concordia student residence? Vaccines and passports A COVID-19 vaccination passport system is in effect in Quebec. In compliance with government guidelines, the vaccination passport is applied to some activities in residence, including the dining hall and all events and activities. Entry into residence and use of common areas and outdoor spaces are exempt. Find more information on vaccinations on the COVID-19 FAQ for international students. Instructions on how to download the vaccination passport on your phone are available online. If you were vaccinated outside of Quebec with a Health-Canada-approved vaccine, use the vaccination registry process before September 15, prior to downloading the vaccination passport. If you were vaccinated in Quebec, download digital proof of your vaccination or the VaxiCode application via the Apple Store or Google Store. Get a laminated card of your vaccination code from the Print Store for only $2.99 +tax. What does not require the vaccination passport? Entry into residence Use of common rooms & kitchenettes Use of bathrooms and laundry rooms Use of outdoor spaces   As an instructor, can I ask students if they are vaccinated? No. Because educational activities don’t require a vaccination passport under government guideline, students do not need to disclose their status to attend a class, lab, studio or other academic event.   As a manager/supervisor, can I ask staff if they are vaccinated? No. Because work-related activities don’t require a vaccination passport under government guidelines, employees do not need to disclose their status. I’m doing an internship or will be involved in a community project. What do I need to do? If you are planning to intern at a health or social services facility this year, the Government of Quebec asks that you advise Concordia if you received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine so we can help you coordinate your internship.

Our services include:Google apps, sites and devices, such as Search, YouTube and Google HomePlatforms such as the Chrome browser and Android operating systemProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, such as ads and embedded Google MapsYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content such as emails and photos, or to see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all; for example, searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.Information that Google collectsWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our servicesWe collect information to provide better services to all our users – from figuring out basic stuff such as which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information that we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application or device that you’re using. This helps us do things such as maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.Things that you create or provide to usWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information – like an email address to receive updates about our services.We also collect the content that you create, upload or receive from others when using our services. This includes things such as email you write and receive, photos and videos that you save, docs and spreadsheets you create and comments that you make on YouTube videos.Information that we collect as you use our servicesYour apps, browsers & devicesWe collect information about the apps, browsers and devices that you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features such as automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.The information that we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including operator name and phone number and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time and referrer URL of your request.We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers – for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things such as your device type, operator name, crash reports and which apps you’ve installed.Your activityWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video that you might like. The activity information that we collect may include:Terms that you search forVideos that you watchViews and interactions with content and adsVoice and audio information when you use audio featuresPurchase activityPeople with whom you communicate or share contentActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our servicesChrome browsing history that you’ve synced with your Google AccountIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information and types and volumes of calls and messages.You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.Go to Google AccountYour location informationWe collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features such as driving directions for your weekend getaway or show times for movies playing near you.Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:GPSIP addressSensor data from your deviceInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers and Bluetooth-enabled devicesThe types of location data that we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices.In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases and server logs.Why Google collects dataWe use data to build better servicesWe use the information that we collect from all our services for the following purposes:Provide our servicesWe use your information to deliver our services, such as processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.Maintain & improve our servicesWe also use your information to ensure that our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services – for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.Develop new servicesWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organised their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.Provide personalised services, including content and adsWe use the information we collect to customise our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalised content and customised search results. For example, Security Check-Up provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information such as apps that you’ve already installed and videos that you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalised ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for 'mountain bikes', you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.We don’t show you personalised ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation or health.We don’t show you personalised ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail or Photos.We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the 'tap to call' button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.Go to Ad SettingsMeasure performanceWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyse data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimise product design. And we also use data about the ads with which you interact to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.Communicate with youWe use information that we collect, such as your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, such as an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.Protect Google, our users and the publicWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks and technical issues that could harm Google, our users or the public.We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyse your content to provide you with things like customised search results, personalised ads or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyse your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognise patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases that you ask it to translate.We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. For example, this helps people identify an email coming from you.We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.Your privacy controlsYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it’s usedThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.

It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an Internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.Browser web storageBrowser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in 'local storage' mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and re-opened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.CookiesA cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognise your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners’ sites or apps.DeviceA device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers and smartphones are all considered devices.Google AccountYou may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorised access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.IP addressEvery device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet.Non-personally identifiable informationThis is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or refers to an individually identifiable user.Personal informationThis is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.Pixel tagA pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.Referrer URLA Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination web page by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last web page the browser visited.Sensitive personal informationThis is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality.Server logsLike most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.A typical log entry for a search for 'cars' looks like this:123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 -740674ce2123e969123.45.67.89 is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 is the date and time of the query.http://www.google.com/search?q=cars is the requested URL, including the search query.Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 is the browser and operating system being used.740674ce2123a969 is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).Unique identifiersA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users and how they can be accessed.Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences and providing personalised advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognise a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customise our service to your device or analyse device issues related to our services.Additional Contextads that you’ll find most usefulFor example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for 'pizza'. Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.advertising and research services on their behalfFor example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns.

In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.devicesFor example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie that you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.ensure and improveFor example, we analyse how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.ensure our services are working as intendedFor example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.information about things near your deviceIf you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, such as Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer) and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (such as MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn morelegal process, or enforceable governmental requestAs with other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data that you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Find out more in our Transparency Report.make improvementsFor example, we use cookies to analyse how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.may link informationGoogle Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites.

Price is required and represents the full up-front payment for your product, including any activation fees and device down payment Activation fees occur for wireless service subscription plans or offers with wireless subscription plans. Fees can include the cost of mandatory, prepaid SIM cards and service down payment. Installments are optional and provide a way to show additional monthly installment payments for your device. Subscription cost is optional and provides the additional monthly cost for a wireless subscription plan. You can provide installments, subscription cost, or both. Your price can be ""0"" when you provide installments, subscription cost, or both. Subscription cost Use the subscription cost [subscription_cost] attribute to submit a series of payments made over a period of time for the telecom services that are bundled with a wireless product offer. Payments are usually made for 6, 12, or 24 months. The currency amount submitted in the feed is a single monthly charge, rather than the total of all the monthly service charges. The subscription plan cost does not include any money used to repay the initial cost of the phone. Note: When displaying the subscription plan cost, Google may round up to the nearest whole unit of local currency to save space. If the installment [installment] attribute is also provided, the value of monthly installment payment will be added to the value of the monthly subscription plan cost before rounding up. The provided value must still exactly match the amount as shown on your site. You should not submit the subscription cost [subscription_cost] attribute for prepaid SIM cards since the full price is paid in advance. Price Use the price [price] attribute to submit a single down payment required to purchase the product. Merchants and service providers will often require a substantial deposit for high-cost products.This may just be the cost of a new SIM card that the customer is required to accept with a new phone. Submit the price [price] attribute as the sum of the activation fee and the down payment. When there is no down payment required for an offer, then the customer may still be required to make the first of the installment payments when they purchase the product, but this is not considered as a down payment in the feed. Submit the correct values for the installment [installment] attribute, and submit ""0"" for the price [price] attribute. If a product offer has no subscription cost or installment, then the down payment is the normal purchase price, and value for a down payment is submitted in the same attribute as a normal price. All costs associated with a wireless product or service must be submitted in a single currency. Installments Use the installment [installment] attribute to submit a series of payments over time to pay back the cost of the product. Wireless products typically follow an installment payment model in order to make it easier for customers to buy an expensive device. The currency amount you submit in the installment [installment] attribute is the amount of a single monthly repayment, not the total of all the monthly repayments. This figure does not include any money used to pay for the telecom services. To simplify the customer experience, it’s recommended that you use the same number of months for both your installment payments and subscription plan. If you use a different number of months for these two agreements, for example, 12 months for the subscription plan and 6 months for the installment payments, then the highest number of months will be shown. Title Use the title [title] attribute to specify that the product you are selling is sold in installments and/or bundled with a subscription plan, for example, a Google Pixel 5” 32GB Very Silver (with contract, 12 monthly installment payments). Example of mobile phones without a subscription plan, sold at a fixed price Follow the same standard as other product types when submitting wireless devices without a subscription plan, sold at a fixed price.

Taking this extra step will ensure that your product can be listed on the actual launch date. You can add your new product data: Before the launch date (recommended) so your product data and campaign setup can ramp up leading to the actual launch announcement. Set the value for the availability [availability] attribute to preorder, and set the value for the availability date [availability_date] attribute to the official release date of the product. This will also allow you to take orders for the product even before the product is released for sale. On or after the launch date, but be aware that it can take up to 72 hours for feed processing to complete. Submit your product data as soon as possible to avoid errors and set the value for the availability [availability] attribute to display as in stock. Especially for new product launches, make sure to submit accurate and optimized product information to set up your ads and free listings for success. Obtain the correct GTINs, optimize your product title [title] to display the important product information, and build your values for the product type [product_type] attribute to at least three levels to capture the most relevant search traffic. Use text ads with price extensions to support SIM-only service contracts Selling SIM-only service contracts without a mobile phone is currently not supported in Shopping ads. Instead, try using Google Ads text ads with price extensions to get your service plans in front of potential customers. Learn more about price extensions Optimize your landing pages for wireless products and services When customers click through to your landing page from your Shopping ad, your product information must match on the landing page to create the most seamless experience. If activation charges or other fees will be applied at checkout, make sure this information is clearly displayed on your landing page before your customer enters your checkout flow. Excluding or showing different product information can mislead and frustrate your customers. Read more about landing page requirements. Pre-select and mark up wireless product variants on your landing page To ensure the most consistent customer experience, make sure to lead customers to a landing page with the preselected mobile phone variant that corresponds to your Shopping ad. This way, when someone clicks through from your ad, they will see the same product variant they were searching for. One way of preselecting product variants is by appending unique URL parameters to your link [link] attribute. Always test to make sure your landing page passes the URL parameter back properly and behaves as expected. For example, your landing page should load a preselected radio button or drop-down selection of the respective phone variant. Additionally, you can allow Google to pull in product information for multiple variants on the same landing page by adding structured data markup to your landing page’s source code. Structured data markup lets Google read your site and pull product data directly from your HTML source code. Learn more about structured data markup By implementing structured data markup and enabling automatic product updates, you can maintain accurate product information automatically, like price and availability. Learn more about automatic product updates Example: Use URL parameters for phone color variants URL parameters for color options: You can pre-select variants to distinguish different color options on the same landing page by adding URL parameters like the following: Silver phone variant: https://store.google.com/product/pixel_phone?sku=_pixel_phone_silver_32gb Black phone variant: https://store.google.com/product/pixel_phone?sku=_pixel_phone_black_32gb Example: Use URL parameters for installment options Landing page example: URL parameters for installment durations: You can pre-select variants to distinguish different installment durations on the same landing page by adding URL parameters like the following: Phone variant with 6-month installments: https://store.google.com/product/pixel_phone?sku=_pixel_phone_silver_32gbinstallments=6 Phone variant with 24-month installments: https://store.google.com/product/pixel_phone?sku=_pixel_phone_silver_32gbinstallments=24 Example: Use URL parameters for service contract options Landing page example: URL parameters for service contract options: You can pre-select variants to distinguish fixed price versus service contract pricing options on the same landing page by adding URL parameters like the following: Phone variant without a service contract: https://store.google.com/product/pixel_phone?sku=_pixel_phone_silver_32gbcontract=no Phone variant with a service contract: https://store.google.com/product/pixel_phone?sku=_pixel_phone_silver_32gbcontract=yes Simplify the purchase flow to a single landing page Make it easier for your customers to choose and purchase their desired wireless product and service bundle on the same landing page. Separating the purchase flow across multiple pages can cause your customers to bounce from your site before completing the purchase. Use feed rules to create custom labels for campaign optimization Feed rules offer a simple and powerful way to transform your product data within Merchant Center. Learn more about feed rules You can use feed rules to apply a custom label for specific products to group your inventory. Then, you can use those custom labels to create ad or product groups in Google Ads for better campaign management and optimization. Learn more about custom labels Example: Create custom labels through feed rules for price buckets Let’s say you have high-priced wireless products and services that deliver a higher return than your low-priced products and services. You can use a conditional Feed Rule to apply custom labels based on price values, like the following: Conditions: Low-priced phones (€0-€200) Mid-priced phones (€200-€500) High-priced phones (€500+) Feed rule: IF ‘price’ is in range ‘0’ AND ‘200.00’ THEN set the value for ‘custom label 0’ to ‘Low-Price’ ELSE IF ‘price’ is in range ‘200.01’ AND ‘500.00’ THEN set the value for ‘custom label 0’ to ‘Mid-Price’ ELSE IF ‘price’ is greater than or equal to ‘500.01’ THEN set the value for ‘custom label 0’ to ‘High-Price’ ELSE preserve any value you may have submitted for ‘custom label 0’ Submitting high-quality product information and landing pages is the backbone to running successful Shopping campaigns. Take steps today to incorporate these best practices for improving and optimizing your product data. The more relevant and clear information you can provide, the more sales you’ll likely drive for your wireless products and services. Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit Need more help?

For example, a high-heeled pump might be made out of leather, denim, or suede. This information helps create accurate filters, which customers can use to narrow search results. If your product has variants that vary by material, then provide that information through this attribute. When to use Required for all products that vary by material Optional for any products where material is an important, distinguishing feature If the material is an important feature of your product, then submit this attribute. We especially recommend that you submit the material attribute if customers might search for your product by material or if they might decide to buy your product based on the material. Format Follow these formatting guidelines to make sure Google understands the data you're submitting. For details on when and how to submit values in English, learn more about submitting your product data Type Unicode characters (Recommended: ASCII only), not case sensitive Limits 0–200 characters Repeated field No Schema.org property (What’s this?) Product.material, Type: Text   File format Example entry Text (TSV) Leather XML (Feeds) <g:material>Leather</g:material> To format your data for Content API, see the Content API for Shopping. Guidelines Follow these guidelines to make sure you submit high-quality data for your products. Minimum requirements These are the requirements you'll need to meet to show your product. If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in the Diagnostics page in your Merchant Center account. Include the main fabric or material that your product is made of. Don’t include values that belong in other attributes such as color [color], size [size], or pattern [pattern]. Submit this attribute for all products that vary by material. Use this attribute when your product is a variant that’s distinguished by its material (for example, black suede shoes and black leather shoes), and also submit each variant with the same value for the item group ID [item_group_id] attribute. Submit only one value. Only a single value will be accepted in the material [material] attribute. If you want to submit a product made of multiple materials, you can specify one primary material followed by up to 2 secondary materials that are each separated by a slash (/) in one single field. Best practices These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your product data for performance. Submit a material whenever it’s relevant. Material is not just for apparel categories. If customers might want to know the material of your product, include that information with this attribute. For example, you might submit material for furniture, curtains, and hardware. Submit a color and a material for precious metals. If your product is made of a precious metal (for example, “gold” or “silver”), submit this information with the material [material] and color [color] attributes. Include up to 3 materials. If your product is composed of multiple materials, you can specify one primary material followed by up to 2 secondary materials that are each separated by a slash (/). For example: cotton/polyester/elastane. Use a value customers will be able to understand. The value you submit can be shown to customers, so avoid abbreviations or internal terms. For example, don’t submit “calf” if you mean “calfskin”, and don’t submit “lthr” if you mean “leather”. Avoid using values that don’t mention the material. This attribute is optional, so if it’s not relevant for your product, don’t use it. For example, don’t submit values like “n/a”, “none”, “multi”, or “other”. Examples Variants If your product has variants of different materials, submit the material for each variant.

If you experience symptoms associated with COVID-19 and your individual travel insurance contract includes Emergency Medical Care coverage, contact our Travel Assistance service immediately to get help. The numbers to reach this 24/7 service are as follows: From Canada or the United States: 1-800-361-6068 (toll free) From Mexico: 01-800-062-3174 (toll free) From the Dominican Republic: 1-800-203-9666 (toll free) From elsewhere in the world: 1-800-7328-7473 (toll free) or 514-286-8411 (collect call) If you cannot reach our Travel Assistance service, do what is necessary to stabilize your condition (e.g., go to a hospital or clinic or contact local emergency services). Once you have been taken care of, call our Travel Assistance service as soon as possible. Please note that you are not covered for emergency medical care if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or are showing symptoms prior departure. Can you send me a letter confirming that you cover COVID-19? If such a document is requested by a government authority, contact us at 514-905-5050 or 1-855-599-5050. Can you guarantee repatriation in case of a medical emergency? Emergency Medical Care insurance can cover emergency repatriation if this service is considered necessary and safe by the travel assistance medical team and the attending physician at the destination. Decisions are based on several factors, including the medical condition of the insured. At all times, the assistance service is dependent on the availability of care and services needed to return home. Inability to access health care or lack of access due to overcrowded medical centres alone does not constitute grounds for emergency repatriation. Anyone planning to travel abroad should take the time to properly assess the essential nature of their trip before making plans. Québec Blue Cross encourage their clients to contact them to clarify the applicable conditions, if necessary. I would like to speak to an agent. Is your Customer Service Department open? Yes.

Because tax can be a complex subject, you have several different options for submitting tax. This article helps you choose the correct option or combination of options. Learn more about how to set up tax settings (US only) Submit taxes correctly for your target country Depending on your target country, you need to follow different requirements when submitting tax information. United States Submit tax rates for products targeting the US. For the US, include tax through the account tax settings or through the tax attribute. If you can’t provide accurate tax rates, provide an overestimate of the average tax rate that you would charge users visiting your site from Google Shopping. If you submit an amount that’s lower than what you actually charge users, your products could be disapproved. To understand what tax rate you should charge, consult your tax advisor. Use the same tax rate in your product data as on your checkout pages. While the tax rate might vary depending on the product or the user’s location, use the Merchant Center tax settings to make sure that users always see the same amount that you charge. Learn more about landing page requirements. Canada Don't include any taxes, such as value-added tax (VAT), sales tax, or import tax, either in the price or the tax attribute when targeting Canada. Display applicable taxes on your checkout pages, so that users can accurately understand the entire cost of your product. Learn more about landing page requirements. Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czechia, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Vietnam Provide the product price, including any value-added tax (VAT) or Goods and Services Tax (GST), in the price [price] attribute and ensure that the landing page price matches the price in your product data. Don’t use the tax [tax] attribute. Learn more about how to submit taxes correctly for your country of sale Determine the states in which you charge tax (US only) In the US, tax rates vary based on the buyer’s or seller’s location, such as state, county, and city. Each state or local tax authority will have its own rules, which will affect how much tax you should collect depending on where your business is required to charge sales tax. Generally, you are required to collect sales tax in any state where you have a sufficient physical presence, such as offices, employees, property, or independent contractors. Each state has its own rules on what is considered a sufficient physical presence. Consult your tax advisor to understand where you are required to collect sales tax. Notice to Shopping advertisers regarding Connecticut sales and use tax In accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-408f(b)(2), Google is required to notify merchants advertising on the Shopping platform of the following information: Connecticut imposes a sales or use tax on sales made to Connecticut purchasers A merchant making sales to Connecticut purchasers must collect and remit sales or use tax to the Department of Revenue Services as required by the Sales and Use Taxes Act Learn more about the Connecticut Sales and Use Taxes Act Understand how states charge taxes (US only) To understand which tax settings to use, you’ll want to know if the states you are required to collect sales tax in charge tax based on origin or destination: Origin-based states charge tax based on the seller’s location within the state. In Merchant Center, you can enter a custom rate for all sales made to a state, which you may want to consider for these states. Destination-based states charge tax based on the destination of the buyer within the state. In Merchant Center, you can select the Google determined rate option, which you may want to consider for these states. In addition, if you sell products in a home rule state, selecting the Google determined tax allows you to manually apply these tax rates to specific cities and counties. Consult your tax advisor to understand how taxes are collected for a specific state. Types of tax settings (US only) The easiest way to set up tax is to use the tax settings in Merchant Center, where you can set up tax rates for each state. You can also override taxes for each product by specifying it in your product data. Whichever method you choose, you’ll need to match the rate that you collect on sales. When setting up rates, you have several options. Depending on your goals, you’ll probably want to use a combination of these options. Consult your tax advisor to understand what tax rate you should charge. Learn more about how to set up tax settings For Buy on Google merchants: In states where marketplace facilitator tax applies, Google is responsible for collecting and remitting sales tax. Your goal You may want to consider this tax setting Don’t collect any taxes in the US Don’t charge sales tax for any state Don’t collect tax in a specific state Set up sales tax for states in which you charge sales tax Only add rates for states where you charge tax. You don’t need to add a rate of 0. Collect a specific rate for an origin-based state Set up custom tax rate Collect a variety of rates for a destination-based state Use Google determined tax rate Collect a variety of rates for a state based on city or county Use Google determined tax rate, applicable to all cities and counties within the state (home rule states only) Collect tax on shipping Apply tax on shipping Collect a non-standard tax rate for a product or exempt a product from tax The tax [tax] attribute How the Google determined tax rate option works (US only) When using account tax settings, you can use the Google-determined tax rate option to automatically determine an appropriate rate. The rate is calculated based on the customer’s location using third-party data. For home rule states, you can select the cities and counties in which to collect sales tax. For non-home rule states, it will automatically charge sales tax throughout the state. While the Google-determined rate is an easy option to set up, keep in mind that it's not a good fit for all situations: Tax rates are destination-based, not origin-based. Google will determine the tax rate based on the customer’s location, so use this method for destination-based states. For origin-based states, you may want to consider using the custom tax rate option or overriding tax settings with the tax [tax] attribute. Tax exemptions and reduced rates aren’t supported. If your product is tax exempt or has a special tax rate, you can’t specify that using the Google determined tax rate option. Instead, override tax settings with the tax [tax] attribute. Consult your tax advisor to understand what tax rate you should charge. Tax on shipping (US only) When using the Google-determined rate, you can specify (for each state) if tax should be applied to shipping cost. If yes, then Google will calculate tax for both the product price and the shipping cost. The tax that customers see will be the sum of those costs. Consult your tax advisor to understand if taxes should be collected for shipping in a specific state.

Cohen Since its creation in 2019, Concordia’s SHIFT Centre for Social Transformation has been developing a network of community and university partners working to respond to community-identified challenges. The centre focuses particularly on problems of systemic injustice, inequity and unsustainability. When the COVID-19 crisis hit Montreal in March, the SHIFT team decided to pivot from their original funding and support program, the second round of which was about to launch. “When we started working from home, we quickly realized that continuing with ‘business as usual’ didn’t make sense,” says SHIFT program manager Susan Edey. “While the pandemic created pressing needs, it also provided opportunities to advance systemic change.” Given that interventions were needed immediately and community leaders were already scrambling to cope with the situation, SHIFT launched a temporary and accelerated funding program. The program strives to support projects that would help address the immediate crisis but also be socially transformative in the long term. Using a streamlined application and selection process, a community-led committee met weekly to make funding decisions. Over eight weeks from April to June 2020 , SHIFT contributed a total of $70,000 to 15 projects aimed at responding to the current health crisis and taking advantage of this unprecedented moment of social transformation. Together, the projects tackle a wide range of social, material and ethical problems. “These projects serve as examples of the innumerable actors in our community who are seizing the moment in this uncertain time,” says Andrea Clarke, senior director of community engagement and social impact at Concordia. “Each of these projects is aiding in our immediate and long-term advancement toward equity, justice, and sustainability. They are helping transform Montreal for the better.” Responses to systemic challenges Some of the funded projects respond to issues of equity and justice that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 situation. For example, Kabit-Bisig Laban Covid will connect vulnerable members of the Filipino community disproportionately affected by the situation. Family caregivers, temporary workers and newly arrived immigrants are being given access to information about their rights and available resources. Other projects seek to use the crisis as an opportunity to rebuild systems and structures, making them stronger and more equitable. Marché commun, for instance, hopes to capitalize on the increased awareness of the essential services provided by delivery drivers. The initiative aims to launch an alternative, socially oriented delivery service that prioritizes the needs of local businesses, delivery workers and consumers. “I’m very inspired by these initiatives,” says Clarke. “I look forward to exploring other ways that SHIFT and Concordia can continue to support these efforts in the months and years ahead.” Upcoming opportunities “As we prepare to enter our second full year of operations, the SHIFT team is working hard to profit from our experience this past spring,"" Edey says. ""We are incorporating the lessons we’ve learned into a slate of offerings that we hope are well suited to supporting social transformation efforts through the next stage of this pandemic. “Since SHIFT’s inception, we have been committed to learning by doing and adapting as we go. This is especially true as we navigate the ongoing crisis.” For details about the 15 projects selected in this round of funding, as well as past and ongoing projects, visit SHIFT’s website. The next funding opportunity will be launched in October 2020.   Related topics 	 health 	 	 COVID-19 	 	 community 	 You might also like: Concordia’s SHIFT funds 7 projects with significant community impact Former Head & Hands leader named Concordia’s senior director of community engagement and social impact Trending Concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the Montreal Climate Partnership November 10, 2021 Improvements to Concordia’s Henry F.

Playoffs Bowl Games Vanier Cup Standings Statistics Teams Records Awards Football Canada Men’s Football Tre Ford, Hec Crighton and the state of U SPORTS football Published: 04 Dec 2021, 11:17 AM 04 December 2021, 11:17 AM Last Update: 04 Dec 2021, 01:00 PM 04 December 2021, 01:00 PM Tyler Mulligan Tre Ford may have won the Hec Crighton, Canada’s highest individual honour in University football, but the battle is just beginning. Ford will look to prove himself at the professional level—a tough feat for any quarterback, but as a person of colour, there are more hoops to jump through than many of his counterparts. As a black quarterback, Ford has always had to fight for what’s rightfully his. Too many times, Black quarterbacks are often given the tag 'athlete' when they can do more than one thing well. Black quarterbacks who can both run and throw the football often get pigeonholed into a seemingly innocuous label of ‘athlete’. While on its surface, being called an ‘athlete’ seems like a good thing, but similar to broader society, for too many years, this has been an excuse to perpetuate a double standard. “Obviously I’m black and I’m also very fast, so people (label) me as an athlete and think, ‘he can flip over and play another position,” said Ford. “I truly believe I’m a quarterback and I feel like if any team gives me a shot, they’ll see that I am a quarterback and not just a receiver and an athlete.” Ford showed why he’s not just an athlete this past season as Waterloo’s pivot. The fifth-year student-athlete was awarded the MVP of U SPORTS football in 2021 after averaging 252 yards per game. Ford became the first Warrior to win the award in program history and a crucial part of his game is his ability to scramble and pick up big yardage on the ground. As a dual-threat, Ford is just as likely to throw a fifty-yard bomb right on the numbers or torch opposing defences with his legs. In 2021, the recreation and leisure major also ranked third in the nation in regular-season rushing yards with 629, averaging over 100 yards per game as a quarterback. Ford’s accomplishments have made him a trailblazer, making history for the University of Waterloo, but more importantly, Ford became the first black quarterback to be awarded the Hec Crighton Trophy. “I would definitely like to see some more black quarterbacks at the university level and get a chance in U SPORTS,” said Ford. “There were times when I was playing back in high school where even if I was outperforming a quarterback, he was still getting looks to be recruited as a quarterback and they said ‘Tre can definitely play receiver at the next level’, or ‘he can play running back’. Black quarterbacks tend to deal with heightened criticism at the quarterback position. Often called into question is whether or not they can make the big throws, or if they’ll just rely on their athleticism and scramble. One of the reasons Ford chose Waterloo was because he was supported as a quarterback, not typecasted into being a receiver because of his speed, as was the case with some of the higher-profile programs. “Some schools talked to me about switching positions, but I was fortunate enough that Bert gave me an opportunity,” said Ford. Luckily for Ford, he had a supportive cast of coaches that gave him the opportunity to succeed in a leadership position. ""Not once did we refer to Tre as an athlete,"" said Waterloo head coach Chris Bertoia. ""We knew he was a quarterback. I told him he would be a quarterback for us, and that he and Tyrell (his brother) were going to turn our program around."" While Ford’s on-field accomplishments have shown a glimpse of societal progression, there’s more work to be done both on and off the field. Corey Grant, the offensive coordinator, and newly-appointed Equity, Inclusion and Anti-Racism Lead at the University of McMaster Athletic Department and, believes that Ford’s nod for the Hec Crighton is both a sign of progress and indicative of a lack of inclusivity within the sport. “Tre Ford is a sign of what we can be in that position for a black quarterback,” said Grant. That’s giving kids an opportunity and not just pigeonholing them… Given the right opportunity and support, they can strive at all positions and especially the quarterback position and he is a great representative of what the future can hold for black and racialized quarterbacks.” Someone always has to be the first. But at the same time, questions should be raised as to why it took this long. “This also shows that there is a lack of that inclusion at the university level. Hopefully, this can start to change the minds of coaches as they’re recruiting quarterbacks. I’m glad that when Tre was recruited he said: ‘No, I don’t want to play another position, I’m a quarterback.’ He’s now setting the table for everybody else.” Although Ford has shown what can be done with the right support, Grant’s unique position as both an authority figure on the field and a liaison of support and inclusivity within the community gives him a voice to speak for those who previously go unheard. “We need someone to speak up and support our racialized student-athletes but also to have that voice that people will listen to,” said Grant, the two-time Grey Cup champion. “They need someone to go to, someone that is in their corner, someone that looks like them, and someone who has been what they’ve been through.” Ford was given an opportunity and he made the most of it. But the job doesn’t end here. Bringing in different perspectives is more important now than ever according to Grant. “If we always have the same voices and perspectives in our coaching rooms, we’re going to stay stagnant. With more women and more diversity in these locker rooms, we’ll help these young men understand how to relate to a diverse pool of individuals and become better leaders of tomorrow,”. Grant will join the Vanier Cup broadcast at halftime to further discussion of inclusivity with U SPORTS football. The Scotiabank Vanier Cup, presented by Levio between the Saskatchewan Huskies and Western Mustangs is televised live on CBC TV. The broadcast is also available online through CBCSports.ca and CBC Gem, and the CBC Sports App. The French broadcast will be available on TVASports.

FAQ Tips and tricks Ouvrir la section: Add a shortcut to your home screen Some browsers allow you to add a shortcut to a website on your device’s home screen. On iPhone (Safari) Open the website in Safari, tap the  icon and select “Add to Home Screen.” On Android (Chrome) Open the website in Chrome, open the menu (the three dots in the top right-hand corner) and select “Add to homescreen.” On Windows phone Open the website in IE Mobile, tap the three dots to the right of the URL and select “Pin to Start.”  Close Ouvrir la section: Add favorites In the Schedules section and in the search results, you will see stars beside items that can be added to favorites. The stars will turn black when selected to indicate that the item has been added. In the Favorites section, tap “home” or “work” to link an address or location. You can also add other favorite locations by tapping the search field and entering an address, intersection, location or stop code. You can then quickly create an itinerary using one of these locations as the arrival or departure point. Lost your favorites?  You may have cleared your browser’s cache. Favorites will remain available as long as you don’t clear your cache or erase your browsing history. Close Ouvrir la section: Turning location settings on and off Check whether you have turned on your phone and browser’s location settings. iPhone Go to Settings, then Privacy, then Location Services. Learn more about turning location services on or off on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Android Go to Settings, then Location, then Use location. Learn more about managing your Android device's location settings. Windows Phone Go to Settings, then Privacy, then Location. Learn more about turning location settings on and off on your Windows phone. Once you have turned location settings on or off on your mobile device, refresh the page to apply the latest changes. Location settings will turn on automatically the next time you visit the mobile site. Close Ouvrir la section: Show departure times for buses with front ramps only Under the Menu tab in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, select “Show departure times for buses with  front ramps only.” Now your search results will show departure times for buses with front ramps only. Close Other questions about site features Ouvrir la section: How do I change the language used? You can change the display language under the Menu tab in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. Close Ouvrir la section: What does the grey circle on the map mean?  The map displays bus stops within a 300-metre radius. If there are six stops or fewer in this area, the radius will expand to 500 metres, then 750 metres, then one kilometre. The grey circle on the map represents the radius used for the list of bus stops. Close Ouvrir la section: Why is there a triangle in the top left-hand corner?  By tapping the triangle, you can access customer alerts (métro service updates, elevator service updates, notices, etc.). The triangle will turn red when a new important alert is available. In the event of a métro service disruption or bus service slowdown, this window will open automatically. You can close it by tapping the x symbol in the top right-hand corner, which will take you back to the mobile site home page. Close Ouvrir la section: Why are the schedules not available offline?  This feature will be released in a later phase. We are currently working to reduce the space needed for this feature on mobile devices. Close Ouvrir la section: Does the trip planner use real-time data? No. The trip planner uses planned schedules. Close Ouvrir la section: How are the bus schedules sorted on the home page? The bus schedules displayed are sorted according to their distance from your location or from the central point on the map when you move it. You’ll see your favourites in the area first, followed by the five bus stops with the earliest arrival times. To view more than the top five stops, tap the “+” button at the bottom of the list. Close Ouvrir la section: Why does my address not work when I enter it in the search field? Double-check the address and its spelling or enter the postal code, an intersection or a five-digit stop code (e.g. 1234 Sainte Catherine, Mont-Royal / St-Denis, H3C 0R5 or 54321). At this time, only addresses on the Island of Montreal can be searched. Close Ouvrir la section: Why is the home page slow to load? Every second, our servers receive a large number of requests for the schedules of each bus on the home page. To improve speed, we have designed the page to display schedules for only the five bus lines closest to your location that will arrive at your stop soon. If you choose to view more lines, this may cause slower loading speeds. If your network connection is too weak, a banner will pop up to inform you that the website is loading slowly due to a poor network connection. The website will continue downloading in the background in the meantime. Close Ouvrir la section: Why is my bus stop's schedule not showing when I use the search function? Double-check the stop code entered. Instead of typing “stop,” “code,” “line,” “bus” or “schedule,” enter the numbers associated with the stop or line in question (e.g. search “15” rather than “line 15”). Close Ouvrir la section: How do you measure bus occupancy levels? Since we launched real-time info, all STM vehicles have been equipped with passenger counters that provide real-time passenger counts for each bus in service. Based on this data and the total capacity of our buses, we can calculate four different levels of occupancy: Level 1 (nearly empty): The number of passengers on the bus is low enough that two-metre physical distancing is possible Level 2 (some seats available): Physical distancing is not possible, but there are still some seats available Level 3 (standing room only): The number of passengers on the bus is higher than the number of seats, so you will probably have to stand Level 4 (nearly full): The number of passengers is high enough that you will probably be able to board, but you will have to stand very close to others Close General Ouvrir la section: Why are we rolling out the website gradually rather than all at once? Putting a beta version online allows us to test the new site’s performance with more users. The old mobile site will be completely replaced with the new version in a few weeks, once all the testing is finished. Close Ouvrir la section: Why a new mobile site?  The last redesign of our mobile site was in 2012. We have had over 24 million visits to our site from mobile devices, which represents approximately 80% of the visits to our site, and it was time to bring the site’s functions up to date. As 86% of visits to our site are made to view schedules or routes, the mobile site had to be adjusted to satisfy our customers’ need to get schedules for nearby buses faster. Close Ouvrir la section: What are the main improvements?  Bus occupancy level in real time Addition of a map and location setting management Ability to add favorites (buses or locations) Easier access to customer alerts General search function available on all pages Accessibility to customers who use VoiceOver and other screen readers Close Ouvrir la section: Why not an app?  Our mobile site was developed as a PWA, a type of software that uses some of your device’s functions to provide a similar experience to a mobile app. PWAs have many other advantages:  Search engine optimization No need to download an app A more streamlined experience tailored to each smart mobile device In addition, our partners Transit and Chrono offer excellent apps, and working with them allows us to meet our customers’ mobile application needs.  Finally, as the last redesign of our mobile site took place in 2012, we felt that an update of the site’s content and functions was in order! Close Ouvrir la section: Why are schedules and next departure times sometimes shown in hours and other times in minutes?  Real-time schedules are displayed in minutes, e.g. 5 min. Planned schedules are displayed in hours, e.g. 14:28 Real-time schedules are made possible by vehicle geolocation. Knowing the exact location of all buses on the road allows us to anticipate the actual time at which a bus will arrive at the next stop. Sometimes a bus’s geolocation is not available, and we are unable to announce next departure times in real time. For this reason, planned schedules is always available. Close Ouvrir la section: Accessibility We are working to make our mobile site conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Level AA. The main accessibility issues with the site have been addressed with the help of a group of STM customers who use VoiceOver and other screen readers. This group contributed to the development of our new mobile site. We are still making improvements to make the user experience easier for users of navigation aids. Here are some issues we will correct in the coming months: In the line details, tabs are misidentified as checkboxes (e.g., line 427 east/west) When a “date” field has not been modified, VoiceOver does not have default information (today’s date) When a time is less than one hour, the abbreviation “min” is read as “minimum” rather than “minute” On métro schedule pages, in the Frequency table under “Weekdays”, screen readers indicate a frequency between 45 and 510 minutes, when it should read, “On weekdays, during peak periods, departures are every four to five minutes and during off-peak periods, every five to ten minutes” Several decorative icons that are read by the screen reader as unpronounceable will be hidden We will continue improving the site in the next few months and update this list as corrections are made. Close   Bus occupancy level  To view bus occupancy levels, go to Schedules in the bottom menu and select a bus line.  The symbol in the upper right corner of the bus icon indicates the real-time occupancy level.  Tap the bus icon to see an explanation of the symbol: Nearly empty. Distancing possible. Some seats available. Distancing not possible. Standing room only. Distancing not possible. Nearly full. This will tell you the buses’ current occupancy levels, not the expected or estimated levels when they arrive at your stop. Métro occupancy level Estimated occupancy levels are available for all Azur trains, on the schedule page for each Orange line station. You can view them on your mobile device at mob.stm.info. Go to Schedules > Métro > Orange line and select your station.  Estimated occupancy levels are calculated from ridership history. The estimated occupancy is a useful tool for planning your trips outside of peak periods whenever possible, making it easier to keep your distance from other customers.

Google Online Security Blog: A new chapter for Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program
",1,"Google Online Security Blog: A new chapter for Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program Security Blog The latest news and insights from Google on security and safety on the Internet A new chapter for Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program July 27, 2021 Posted by Jan Keller, Technical Program Manager, Google VRP A little over 10 years ago, we launched our Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP). Our goal was to establish a channel for security researchers to report bugs to Google and offer an efficient way for us to thank them for helping make Google, our users, and the Internet a safer place. To recap our progress on these goals, here is a snapshot of what VRP has accomplished with the community over the past 10 years:Total bugs rewarded: 11,055Number of rewarded researchers: 2,022Representing 84 different countriesTotal rewards: $29,357,516To celebrate our anniversary and ensure the next 10 years are just as (or even more) successful and collaborative, we are excited to announce the launch of our new platform, bughunters.google.com.This new site brings all of our VRPs (Google, Android, Abuse, Chrome and Play) closer together and provides a single intake form that makes it easier for bug hunters to submit issues. Other improvements you will notice include:More opportunities for interaction and a bit of healthy competition through gamification, per-country leaderboards, awards/badges for certain bugs and more!A more functional and aesthetically pleasing leaderboard. We know a lot of you are using your achievements in the VRP to find jobs (we’re hiring!) and we hope this acts as a useful resource.A stronger emphasis on learning: Bug hunters can improve their skills through the content available in our new Bug Hunter UniversityStreamlined publication process: we know the value that knowledge sharing brings to our community. That’s why we want to make it easier for you to publish your bug reports.Swag will now be supported for special occasions (we heard you loud and clear!)We also want to take a moment to shine a light on some aspects of the VRP that are not yet well-known, such as:Submitting patches to open-source software is eligible for a rewardWe have rewards for research papers on the security of open sourceYour open-source software might be eligible for a subsidyWhen we launched our very first VRP, we had no idea how many valid vulnerabilities - if any - would be submitted on the first day. Everyone on the team put in their estimate, with predictions ranging from zero to 20. In the end, we actually received more than 25 reports, taking all of us by surprise.Since its inception, the VRP program has not only grown significantly in terms of report volume, but the team of security engineers behind it has also expanded – including almost 20 bug hunters who reported vulnerabilities to us and ended up joining the Google VRP team.That is why we are thrilled to bring you this new platform, continue to grow our community of bug hunters and support the skill development of up-and-coming vulnerability researchers. Thanks again to the entire Google bug hunter community for making our vulnerability rewards program successful. As you continue to play around with the new site and reporting system, tell us about it - we would love to hear your feedback. Until next time, keep on finding those bugs!

First, a Concordia professor must agree to host you on campus for a specific project and set period of time AND be willing to obtain the necessary approval from her or his department in order for you to be issued an official Letter of Invitation to Concordia. Where applicable, she or he must also be willing to pay the required Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada’s (IRCC) $230 employer compliance fee of $230 using either a Concordia corporate card or their own credit card so that an IRCC Offer of Employment may be issued so you can apply for a work permit.  Concordia University does not cover this fee; the inviting professor is responsible for identifying funding for it and under no circumstances can they ask you to cover or reimburse them for it. If you are unfamiliar with Concordia, the following list of academic units and departments and website for exploring research at Concordia is a good starting point for identifying Concordia professors whose fields of expertise correspond to yours. Please be advised, however, that Concordia professors are not obliged to host academic visitors and Concordia International cannot find a professor to invite you to campus for you. In order for a professor to invite you to campus, she or he will need the following information from you.  We advise that you supply this information to the professor at least six (6) months before your expected arrival date in Canada.   Section 1 of the Academic Visitor Request Form completed. A letter from your home institution indication your affiliation/status there. A copy of your curriculum vitae. A photocopy of your passport page showing personal information (photo, name, date of birth, etc.) if you are not a Canadian citizen or other similar identification document if you are Canadian. If you are a Canadian permanent resident, please also include a copy of your valid permanent resident card.  If you already hold an open temporary work permit authorizing you to work anywhere in Canada for the duration of your visit, please include a copy of the same. If the request is approved by the University, you will receive an official Letter of Invitation (LOI), an Acceptance Form and, where applicable, CIC immigration documents for you to apply for a Temporary Work Permit. Sign and return the Acceptance Form as instructed on and use the other document to begin applying for a Temporary Work Permit. Please don’t apply for a visa or work permit until such time that Concordia provides you with the required documentation. Pre-departure information Immigration: If you are not a Canadian citizen, permanent resident or do not hold an open work permit for the duration of your visit, then you are responsible for obtaining any and all immigration documents required for you to enter Canada and conduct your research project at Concordia. Immigration options to foreign Academic Visitors include: Work Permit Exemptions: 120-day work permit exemption for researchers. For further details, please visit http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/researcher-exemption.asp; 15/30-day work permit exemption for highly skilled workers. For further details, please visit http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/short-term-exemption.asp; Self-funding researcher may be eligible to work without obtaining a work permit if they meet the criteria for the business visitor category: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/permit/business/index.asp. The Business Visitors category also includes foreign professors and researchers seeking entry to Canada to evaluate academic university programs or research proposals as well as Seminar Leaders or Guest Speakers provided the seminar does not last more than five (5) days. Work Permits: according to current regulations, most academic visitors are required to obtain a Temporary Work Permit regardless of whether or not you receive any compensation in Canada. Temporary Work Permits may be based on Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) or Exempted exempt from LMIA requirement. Please be advised that Concordia will not apply for an LMIA for any academic visitor should you not qualify for an exemption. There are several relevant LMIA exemptions for Academic Visitors, including:   Exemption C20: “Canadian interests - Reciprocal employment general”. Your home institution must have an existing reciprocal, bilateral exchange agreement with Concordia. For a list of current Concordia bilateral partners, please consult: http://www.concordia.ca/international/partnerships.html; Exemption C21: International Experience Canada for the citizens of certain countries Canada has an agreement with. Please verify if you’re eligible to apply here: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/iec/eligibility.asp; Exemption C22: Reciprocal employment – Academic exchanges designed mainly for Guest Lecturers and Visiting Professors: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/opinion/academic.asp;  http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/opinion/policy.asp; Exemption T23: NAFTA Professionals allows US and Mexican Research assistants and Professors to obtain a work permit exempted from the LMIA requirement; International Non-Trade Agreements [R204(a) – T11], such as Fulbright Program between Canada and the U.S., Scientific and Technical Cooperation Agreement between Canada and Germany, etc.; Other International Mobility Programs (i.e. Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement; International Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) - Canada-Peru, Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, etc.). You are responsible for informing yourself of CIC requirements for applying for any travel documents you might need.  Insurance: CIC will require you to obtain a Canadian health insurance policy for the duration of your stay in Canada. Health insurance policies vary in coverage and price, but the insurance you choose should cover at least 80% of any medical treatment you receive. You should also take any personal health condition in consideration when selecting a policy. In addition to health insurance, you are also responsible for making sure make sure you have appropriate travel, repatriation, emergency medical evacuation, liability and any other type of insurance you may deem necessary.  Many companies sell insurance policies in Québec. You are encouraged to do as much research as you can, but here are a few to help get you started: Blue Cross Student Guard Desjardins RBC Make an appointment with your supervising professor: Once you know when you will be arriving, you should contact your supervising professor to schedule an appointment to meet her or him, visit the location where you will be conducting your research internship and coordinate any other remaining details. Arrival information Finding Accommodations in Montreal:  Academic visitors to Concordia are responsible for securing their own accommodations while here.  If you are coming during the summer months, you may request on-campus accommodations, for more information please contact Summer accomodations. Throughout the rest of the year, you will have to search and secure your own apartment or other accommodations.  Luckily, finding accommodations in Montreal is relatively easy and inexpensive when compared to other major North American cities. To get started on finding out how to search for an apartment in Montreal, please visit Concordia’s page on off-campus housing. Your status at Concordia: As an academic visitor at Concordia, you will be considered as a visitor. You will not be able to register for courses at Concordia as an academic visitor and will not have access to the same types of services offered to registered, tuition-paying Concordia students will not be eligible for reduced fares on the subway and bus systems. University Identification: As soon as you arrive, you should obtain a Concordia University I.D. It will give you access to certain parts of the campus that require it, such as the library and the shuttle bus. To obtain an I.D., please take your Letter of Invitation, Passport, Work Permit and address in Montreal to Human Resources (SGW FB-1130/1250, rue Guy) between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday through Friday.

Did you know? The withdrawal of the MR-63 cars is closely linked to the arrival of the AZUR métro cars. Before removing train units, we have to ensure that we have enough trainsets to provide service. Then, we choose which train units to remove based on when they are due for their annual maintenance. Seven finalist projects Following the call for proposals launched in March 2016 to give a second life to the MR-63 métro cars, we announced the finalists that were selected among the thirty submissions received. We evaluated all submissions according to the same criteria: image and heritage; environment and sustainability; quality of concept; guarantee of project delivery and quality of proposal; feasibility and logistics. Projects currently underway Over the coming months, the finalists will have to meet certain conditions to receive final approval for their project. These include land-use approval, handling and transport plan, taking possession, and respect for the public and collective character of the project. Most of the of finalists signed the sales contract and are moving forward with the work to complete their project. A first batch of materials, in this case a group of 16 doors and their opening and closing mechanisms, was delivered to artist Michel de Broin, who is creating a sculpture for the Quartier des spectacles. His work, entitled Seuils, will be displayed this fall.

Close Ouvrir la section: Evaluation of proposed projects Selection process The selection committee will start by reviewing submissions based on the evaluation criteria. The results of their analysis will be presented to the STM's executive officers who, in turn, will submit a recommendation to the STM’s board of directors. The board will choose the finalists and its decisions in this matter will be final. The STM reserves the right not to select any project if none adequately meet all evaluation criteria. Selection committee The selection committee consists of: One STM representative representing each of the following branches: sustainable development, environment, architecture, major projects, métro rolling stock, marketing, arts and heritage One external member representing the design and architecture community One external member representing the arts and heritage assets community One external member representing the business community Evaluation criteria We remind you that, first and foremost, bidders will be fully responsible for all risks related to their project, thereby excluding the STM of any and all liability. Below is a list of the criteria used to evaluate project proposals, regardless of whether the projects are temporary or permanent: Image and heritage: the project must have a positive impact on the STM’s corporate image, as well as public scope and reach, and provide a collective experience for all. Environment and sustainability: the project must have a minimal impact on the environment and community, show that it complies with any objectives set for the deployment zone, and include a plan for the final disposal of the MR-63 cars. Quality of concept: the project must be achievable (demonstrate its feasibility) and fully detailed, with its objectives and target market clearly and precisely identified. Guarantee of project delivery and quality of proposal: the document must reflect the bidder’s clear understanding of all parameters, solid framework for the project, as well as financial and technical ability to carry out the project. Feasibility and logistics: the project’s time frame and deployment must take into consideration the availability of the MR-63 cars.   Close Do you know the story of the MR-63 cars? Texte important Did you know that?  The term MR-63 refers to matériel roulant, meaning rolling stock, from 1963  A train consists of one, two or three units A unit, in turn, consists of three métro cars, two motor and one trailer A motor car has four electric traction motors and a driving cab A trailer car has no traction of its own, but it holds auxiliary equipment, like compressors, batteries and more Why a métro running on tires in Montréal? 			It’s been said that it was the mayor of Montréal, Jean Drapeau, who chose to have a métro running on tires built in Montréal. That’s not exactly true: Drapeau wanted a monorail, while the executive committee chairman, Lucien Saulnier, was set on getting a métro. The two went to Paris together to assess the two transportation modes, and the métro easily won over the other. The Régie autonome des transports parisiens (RATP) had been operating rubber-tired cars in the Paris Métro since the 1950s, specifically on Line 1, their network’s most heavily-used line. If a métro running on rubber tires could handle the busiest line in the Paris Métro, it could certainly be used in Montréal’s brand new system! 			Photo: RATP Archives French concept, Quebec design    			Although they were based on the French system, Montréal’s first métro cars were designed in Quebec by Jacques Guillon's firm. He insisted that the cars be built here and not in France as some were initially expected to be. He then altered the basic design of the Paris Métro cars by rounding out their silhouette, which added a few more centimetres of space for passengers. From the outset, the cars were to be made of aluminium, but in the end, they had a steel construction. As the Montréal system is entirely underground, the cars were not designed to withstand outdoor weather. 			Photo: Jacques Guillon Archives Blue or red for the métro?  			The colour of the métro cars was always a little contentious. For designer Jacques Guillon, the cars had to be blue, the colour of the Quebec flag and, for pragmatic reasons, a colour that can easily be cleaned. For Mayor Drapeau, on the other hand, it had to be red, the City of Montréal’s colour! But the designer stood his ground and they were painted blue with a white stripe, like the Paris Métro cars at the time. But which shade of blue? Some say it was the colour of a dress worn by the mayor’s wife, others say it was the colour of a tie worn by Lucien Saulnier… who knows? In the end, no one wants to change the colour of our métro! 			Photo: Ville de Montréal Archives A full-scale mock-up    			After building a toy-size model, which is currently under the stewardship of the Musée du Québec, the designers started building a full-scale mock-up of Montréal’s future métro car. They used a Commission de transport workshop and, in no time, the wood structure began to take shape. It was a hit at the Exposition française held at the Palais du Commerce in 1963, on the site of today’s Grande Bibliothèque. As you can see on the front of the mock-up, the Orange Line 2 was initially supposed to end at Crémazie. Also note the vehicle’s headlights, later modified, and the coat of arms of the City of Montréal, which were dropped along the way. 			Photo: Ville de Montréal Archives What does MR-63 mean?    			MR-63 refers to matériel roulant conçu en 1963, meaning rolling stock designed in 1963. In the case of the MR-63 cars, this is even more accurate as the contract to manufacture the cars was also awarded in 1963. For the MR-73 cars, it gets a little more complicated: although they were designed in 1973, a builder was only found for them the next year, in 1974. Notice how Montréal did not follow in Paris’s tracks (literally) in their way of labelling train cars, with ""MP"" for matériel pneumatique (rolling stock on rubber tires) and ""MF"" for matériel fer sur fer (rolling stock with steel wheels on steel tracks). However, that changed a few years ago, when our new métro car design was nicknamed MPM-10 for matériel sur pneumatiques de Montréal conçu en 2010 (rolling stock on rubber tires designed in 2010). 			Photo: Ville de Montréal Archives 			  More expensive than expected   			In March 1963, the City of Montréal issued a call for tenders for the supply of 279 MR-63 cars, or 31 nine-car trainsets. While the city expected to pay some $20 million, it quickly lost any illusions: the bids by Canadian Vickers and Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) are both in excess of $40 million! Back to the drawing board. Luckily, the tunnels cost much less to build than was originally thought, making it possible to move up construction on additional sections and even add a line below the river… So more cars were needed to serve this expanded network, 369 to be exact. This time, the bids were more reasonable and Canadian Vickers was awarded the contract, for $45,513,918. 			Photo: Ville de Montréal Archives Canadian Vickers 			Choosing Canadian Vickers to build the MR-63 cars came as a surprise to many. True, the company was specialized in building and refurbishing naval ships and did not have the experience of the other bidder, Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW). However, Vickers had the support of CIMT-Lorraine, the French reference in terms of rubber-tired métros and relied on many subcontractors to produce the parts needed to operate the cars. For this contract, it also set up a new workshop at the corner of Notre-Dame and Viau. History has shown that, after all, the shipbuilder made very good métro cars, only borrowing their… foghorn!  			Photo: Ville de Montréal Archives 336 or 369 MR-63 cars? 			Incredibly, Vickers was able to deliver 369 MR-63 cars between 1965 and 1967. Yet the STM’s documents show that only 336 of these cars are still in operation. So where are those 33 missing cars? To begin with, 24 cars were destroyed in the December 8, 1971, fire in the tail tracks behind Henri-Bourassa station (photo). Then, nine other cars were also completely burned on January 9, 1974, in a fire that broke out between Laurier and Rosemont stations. As these cars were never replaced, the number of MR-63s went from 369 to 336. 			Photo: STM Archives From six-digit numbers to five 			Initially, a six-digit number was assigned to each MR-63 car. Thus, the identification numbers for motor cars started at 81-1501, while those of trailer cars started at 80-0001. For example, the cars making up the very first three-car unit were numbered 81-1501, 80-0001 and 81-1502, while those making up the 123rd and final unit were numbered 81-1745, 80-0123 and 81-1746. Later, when it was decided that the MR-73 cars would be assigned numbers starting with 78 or 79, the numbering system for the MR-63s was simplified by dropping the first number after the hyphen. This is why motor cars are now numbered from 81-501 to 81-746, and trailer cars from 80-001 to 80-123. 			Photo: STM Archives Unveiling the very first cars    			August 24, 1965, was a very big day at the Canadian Vickers’ workshop on Notre-Dame. The first three cars for the Montréal métro were unveiled with pomp and ceremony. The event was attended by Mayor Drapeau and his wife, the chairman of the city’s executive committee, Lucien Saulnier, the métro’s chief engineer, Lucien L’Allier, and Cardinal Paul-Émile Léger, whose red robes contrasted sharply with the new train’s blue and white livery. Officials and dignitaries stood aboard car 81-1502 (81-502 today) for the official photo, seen here, often mistaken for the métro’s inaugural photo. Far from it! Another year went by before the public was able to board the MR-63 cars, on October 14, 1966. 			Photo: Ville de Montréal Archives Not everyone can be a train operator!   			It may be simpler than flying a plane, but operating a métro is still relatively complex. The story goes that Cardinal Léger, who was handed the controls of a train during a visit, was jolted when the train came to a sudden stop. The reason? In a moment of joy, he raised his arms towards heaven, releasing the train controls for a little too long and setting off the emergency brakes! Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa experienced a similar mishap when the Green line extension was inaugurated in 1976 (photo). Programed to cover a precise distance, his train stopped mid-platform at Joliette station… because the train had left Préfontaine from the middle of the platform instead of the end! 			Photo: STM Archives Do you recognize him?   			If you look closely at the cover page of the souvenir book issued for the inauguration of the Montréal Métro in 1966, and again at the picture of Premier Bourassa at the controls of an MR-63 ten years later, you’ll notice the same métro employee is standing in the driver’s cab! He is Marcel Laramée who, in his career, was a tramway motorman, bus driver, inspector, traffic regulator, train supervisor and superintendant. Mr. Laramée confirms that the 1966 photo was carefully staged: the train was stopped a third of the distance from the front end of the platform, and the people, all extras, were wearing fall clothes in a variety of colours…. despite the picture being taken in July! 			Photos: STM Archives Two very special trains    			In addition to the 369 MR-63 cars for passenger service, Canadian Vickers delivered five other cars on tires, divided into two very special trains. The collection train (top photo) was used in the métro until the early 2000s; designed to collect fare revenues and trash, it was finally disposed of, as other service vehicles could carry out that task. In some stations, you can still see the letter C marking the exact location where that three-car train unit had to stop… As for the other one, the dust collector train (bottom photo), it still runs at night removing any dust from the tracks. On that train, two modified motor cars frame a huge vacuum cleaner, 1,500 times the capacity of your ones at home! 			Photos: STM Archives 			 		 It’s really warm in the métro! 			The French engineers had equipped the MR-63 cars with a heating system, concerned about our rigorous winters. But it’s actually the reverse that happened: by releasing more heat than anticipated and having an inadequate ventilation system, the cars became rolling saunas! It was so hot inside them that in July 1967, an operator fainted and his train hit the wall at the end of the tunnel on the Yellow line (photo). The solution consisted of installing more powerful ventilation fans, replacing certain windows with metallic screens and adding air conditioning inside the driver’s cab, which required the removal of a passenger seat on each motor car. The ceiling also had to be raised at Place-des-Arts station because with the new overhead air intakes, the train cars could no longer squeeze through!  			Photo: STM Archives Backlit ads    			If you compare the inside of today’s MR-63 car to the original one, a big difference is immediately apparent: in the beginning, ads were placed directly on the overhead light panels, like we see in buses today. The métro network map was also installed above each set of doors, which explained its strange horizontal format. Moving the ads and network map to their current location between the windows, just above the single seats, only came about in the mid-1970s. Indeed, following the 1971 and 1974 fires, authorities determined that the ads placed directly on light panels had contributed to spreading the flames inside the cars. 			Photo: Ville de Montréal Archives MR-63 trains that sing dou-dou-dou!   			In an effort to reduce the heat released when trains departed a station, the decision was made to install a new electronic modulating system called a ""chopper circuit"" on the new MR-73 cars. For testing purposes, two MR-63 trains were equipped with the system: units 10, 11 and 12 got a Hitachi system, while units 40, 41 and 42 got a Jeumont system. In the end, the latter with its now-famous dou-dou-dou was chosen for all MR-73 cars. The Hitachi train was converted back to normal, but not the Jeumont train, which quickly became inoperative. The solution: the Jeumont train’s units were separated and placed between two normal train units. For this reason, there are a few MR-63 trains that also make the dou-dou-dou sound! 			Photo: STM Archives Santa’s train    			If you’ve ever seen Santa Claus at the controls of a métro train, you weren’t dreaming! From the early 70s to the mid-90s, Plaza Alexis-Nihon and Place Bonaventure took turns announcing Santa’s arrival by métro! Backed by a huge advertising campaign, an entire train was set aside and passengers were encouraged to exit the train at the right station. Increasingly, we saw MR-63 cars dressed up in Christmas colours and driven by Santa himself! In a way, it set the stage for all the dressed up cars we’ve seen in the métro since 1996. The first two ad campaigns in the series were Levi’s Silver Tab jeans and the Quebec federation of milk producers.  			Photo: STM Archives The official car for the 1976 Games   			Stations from Préfontaine to Honoré-Beaugrand on the Green line opened their doors in June 1976, just in time for the summer Olympics the next month. But the new MR-73 cars from Bombardier were not ready in time, because of a labour dispute at the plant in La Pocatière. Thus, the MR-63 cars came to the rescue on the newly extended line, transporting crowds of visitors and athletes during the entire Games. Regrettably, history has forgotten about this feat and many people today still believe the MR-73 cars were used during the ’76 Olympics… when in fact they were still on the assembly line in La Pocatière! 			Photo: STM Archives Auto-pilot, single operator     			Although less technologically advanced than the MR-73s, the older MR-63s were the first to feature an auto-pilot. Initially tested on the Yellow line in August 1975, the system was deployed on the Green line starting in November 1976 (photo), as only MR-63 métro cars were operating on that line. The auto-pilot system was then deployed on the Orange line starting in 1980, followed by the Blue line when it opened in 1986. At that time, trains began running with a single operator at the controls, a change in operational procedures that was implemented on the Orange line in 1989 and later on the Green line in 1993. An exception persists to this day, with two operators still driving the métro manually on the Yellow line, because of the line’s particular layout. 			Photo: STM Archives From one line to another… and back 			The arrival of the MR-63 cars from 1976 on also signalled the gradual withdrawal of the MR-63s from the Green line. Indeed, it was the longest line at the time, and it featured a brand new maintenance shop next to Honoré-Beaugrand station, so it made sense for it to have the newer rolling stock. The MR-63s were moved to the Orange and Yellow lines, where, eventually, they were also replaced by the MR-73s. However, in the early 1980s, expansion of the CTCUM’s Youville maintenance shops and, to a lesser degree, the extension of the Orange line to Côte-Vertu, had the opposite effect: the MR-73 cars were transferred back to the Orange line and the MR-63s returned to the Green line. They were also later redeployed on the Yellow line in the mid-2000s.  			Photo: STM Archives Sacrificing métro cars for a good cause     			Following the fire between Laurier and Rosemont stations in 1974, the CTCUM’s fire prevention department created their own school, where fires in the métro could be simulated, for training purposes. In 1979, the school was installed at the end of the tunnel north of Henri-Bourassa station, right where the métro’s other major fire happened in 1971. Three MR-63 cars that were salvaged from the 1974 fire were used to train thousands of métro employees and firefighters throughout the region. Plans to extend the line into Laval forced the school to relocate. After a brief stint at the Henri-Bourassa garage, it settled permanently below Parc Jeanne-Sauvé, where the only remaining serviceable car from the 1974 fire was lowered to the underground training centre, along with two cars from the old collection train. 			Photo: STM Archives The first woman at the controls   			In 1977, Francine Maltais became the first woman to drive a bus in Montréal. But as métro operators were generally former bus drivers, it was only a matter of time before a woman applied for the job. That honour was claimed by Lisette Renaud, hired as a bus driver in 1980 and trained as an MR-63 métro operator the very next year. If that turned out to be an excellent career move for her, a number of customers did not share that view: when seeing a woman at the controls, many refused even to board the train, preferring to wait for the next one! Luckily, reactions of that kind were few and quickly disappeared… 			Photo: STM Archives Refurbished for a longer life     			From 1991 to 1993, all 336 MR-63 cars underwent a complete overhaul by a division of the Canadian National railway (CN), later renamed the AMF. The $60-million refurbishing operation extended the métro cars’ lifespan by some twenty years or so. One by one, they were moved by trailer truck from the STCUM’s Youville shops to the CN’s workshops in Pointe-Saint-Charles, and back again. The interior and exterior look of the cars was slightly updated at that time. The older sectional floor was replaced by a one-piece floor covering, the black leatherette seats made way for white fibreglass seats, and the cars’ all-white front exterior was painted blue with a simple white line, like the MR-73s. 			Photo: STM Archives The ""pivot affair""  			In November 1993, when refurbishment of the MR-63 cars was about to wrap up, the STCUM temporarily withdrew more than 300 of them from service because of a technical issue. Cracks were detected on a pivot, connecting the car body and bogie. Not wishing to take any risks, the STCUM chose to remove each of the renovated MR-63 cars from service and inspect them one by one, which took nearly two weeks (photo). In the meantime, transit users had to cool their heels, as métro service was provided by a limited number of trains. So, for a very short period of time, the MR-63 cars let the MR-73s completely take over the Green line…. 			Photo: STM Archives A métro for…. Just for Laughs 			With the Montréal Métro being entirely underground, it’s safe to say that the last place you would ever expect to find a métro car is in the street…. In 2008, Just for Laugh festival regulars were more than a little surprised to find a real métro car on Ontario Street, transformed into an ice cream stand! That unusual experience was repeated the following year, this time with a métro car that was turned into a ""transit cocktail bar."" It was good old car 81-579, a motor car from the ancient Jeumont train. That train’s unit 40 was finally scrapped, for lack of spare parts, bringing the number of MR-63 cars from 336 to 333. 			Photo: STM Archives Fewer seats, more room     			Faced with constantly increasing ridership levels, in the early 2000s, the STM redesigned the interior layout of the MR-63 and MR-73 cars, by cutting back on seats so that the cars could hold more passengers. In the MR-73s, the central aisle was widened when double seats were replaced by single ones, bringing the number of seats from 40 to 34. Unfortunately, transforming double seats into single ones was not possible on the MR-63 cars, because the double seats housed the door opening mechanism. It was instead decided to remove the single seats at each end of the cars, leaving each car with 32 seats. 			Photo: STM Archives Ouvrir la section: More about the new life for the MR-63 cars Millions of people like you ride the métro each day: to work, to the movies or a show, to cheer on the Montréal Canadiens hockey team or to meet with a friend at a restaurant, no matter how you use it, our métro is part of your daily life. From the very beginning, the MR-63 cars have been an integral part of highly successful events in Montréal, from Expo 67 to the 1976 Olympics: two major events in the city’s history that attracted millions of visitors from Montréal and around the world. And still, today, from the Montréal en lumière festival in winter to the International Jazz Festival in summer, you can always count on our métro to get you there! Now, our MR-63 métro cars have reached the end of their service life. Did you know that each one has travelled some 4,000,000 kilometres1? Yes, and now it's time to let them go. No need to worry, though. Their withdrawal from service will be gradual, as the new AZUR métro cars are delivered, and the same level of métro service will be maintained throughout for customers. For the STM, the whole project involves: Disposing of the MR-63 métro cars Managing our stock of MR-63 spare parts Optimizing any earnings from this project Adhereing to principles of sustainability and sound environmental management Ouvrir la section: The MR-63s and sustainability One of the six priorities identified in the STM’s 2020 Strategic Plan makes sustainable development central to all corporate decisions. In its 2020 Sustainable Development Plan, the STM officially committed to continuously improve upon the environmental, social and economic performance of its business processes and activities. Indeed, the STM is aiming to divert 75% of residual materials from final disposal and to include sustainability criteria in 90% of all purchase or disposal contracts by 2020. It is therefore essential to act upon principles of sustainability in the process of permanently eliminating the MR-63 rolling stock. Ouvrir la section: What can be done with cars once they’ve reached the end of their service life? For the STM, it is important to properly plan for the dismantlement and reclamation of these cars by including environmental and social considerations, particularly the 3R-RD principle. So we undertook a multi-step process to determine our best options: We consulted with the STM’s internal and external stakeholders We consulted with experts in sustainability issues We carried out a benchmarking study with other companies and transit operators around the world to learn about best practices and services available on the market Lastly, we issued a call for proposals And from an historical conservation perspective, we also: Approached a number of museums  Listened to comments and suggestions from the public Ouvrir la section: What is the 3R-RD principle? 3R-RD refers to the progressive order in which the management of residual materials and hazardous waste materials is preferably carried out: reduction, reuse, recycling, reclamation and, lastly, disposal. This strategy allows for the recovery of some residual materials instead of outright final disposal of them all. 					REDUCTION AT SOURCE The first step calls for avoiding the production of residual materials from the initial design, through manufacturing, distribution and consumption of a given product. However, as the MR-63 cars were built from 1963 to 1967, this principle cannot apply to today’s disposal process. REUSE / REPURPOSE Reusing means giving an object the opportunity to be used again, without significantly modifying its appearance or properties. A few options were considered, such as:    Selling them to other public transit companies We got in touch with transit authorities in four cities, namely Mexico City, Santiago, Marseille and Lyon, as they also operate their métro system with rubber tires, and offered to sell them our MR-63 cars. 					But, because our cars are at the end of their service life, especially in terms of their technology, all responses were negative. Other properties, like their non-standard gauge and the fact they were never designed for outdoor operations, also limited their potential for reuse.  Issuing a request for proposals  This step was intended to attract the attention of business enterprises specialized in recycling that are capable of handling the disposal of MR-63 métro cars or of any other company interested in acquiring one or more cars and repurposing them as part of a special project. Reusing compatible spare parts on MR-73 cars We conducted a study that enabled us to confirm that some spare parts for MR-63 rolling stock can be reused for MR-73 maintenance and repairs. Exhibiting in a museum These cars have been a part of daily life for most Montrealers for the past 50 years. They made public transit history. For this reason, we approached Exporail, the Canadian Railway Museum in Saint-Constant, to ensure one car was added to their collection. RECYCLING This process aims to transform residual materials in such a way as to reintroduce them into the production cycle of an altogether new product. In light of the sheer number of MR-63 cars, recycling is indispensable to successfully maximize the reclamation of materials and reduce our environmental footprint. We issued a call for tenders to obtain the services of a company that can see to the collection, transportation, dismantling, and reclamation (through recycling) of residual materials from MR-63 cars according to the 3R-RD principle. Bidders will be evaluated by a selection committee that will base its decision on specific criteria, including sustainability, ability to deliver, previous related experience and cost. RECLAIMING One such process involves the recovery of energy produced by the chemical transformation of residual materials (e.g. combustion of residual materials to produce energy). Some hard-to-recycle métro car components could serve to feed cement factory furnaces. FINAL DISPOSAL As a last resort, any and all residual material that cannot be recycled will be sent to a landfill site for final disposal. Ouvrir la section: What kind of materials are used to build métro cars? Working together, the STM’s engineering department and the Centre de transfert technologique en écologie industrielle (CTTÉI) identified the nature of MR-63 components and their weight, in order to draw up a complete list of all materials and ensure the final disposal of the MR-63 cars was responsibly handled. Their estimates gave guidance and shape to our dismantling and reclamation process. Impressive numbers The combined weight of our fleet of MR-63 cars is estimated at over 7,200 metric tons! Below is a chart illustrating the main materials found in our MR-63 métro cars. Metals 									(parts made of steel, copper, stainless steel, aluminum, etc.)  89.8 % Other materials Wood (underneath floorings and brake shoes):  1.1% 									Composite materials (interior panels, floors, etc.):  0.8% 									Other materials (electronic components, polycarbonates, lubricants, etc.):  1.9% 									Rubber (tires, suspension, seals):  3.8% 10.2 % Ouvrir la section: And elsewhere in the world? To find out more about our options for these cars, we looked into what other transit authorities had done when they were faced with the disposal of a large quantity of métro railcars. Paris hired a recycling firm to dispose of its older rolling stock, paying careful attention to how hazardous residual materials were handled and processed. London reused some cars to create an artists’ village but, as with Paris, most of the cars were recycled. Buenos Aires donated two cars to a rail club, converted two others into diesel-electric buses and restored yet another two for tourist lines. As for the rest of their fleet, they are still looking for an ideal solution. New York, on the other hand, sank a few thousand such cars offshore after carefully removing all traces of hazardous residual materials. Contrary to the Big Apple, the STM chose not to use its métro cars to create artificial reefs in surrounding waters. Indeed, our cars were designed for indoor use, inside tunnels, sheltered from the weather, and by their very nature would quickly disintegrate after being submerged. Skeptical?

If some of your products are below this minimum order value, a customer cannot buy the products on their own. In these situations, it’s especially important that you set your minimum order value. If you offer free shipping beginning at a certain order amount and charge a shipping cost for any lower amount, do not add a minimum order value in your shipping settings. Only set the minimum order value if you do not ship orders below that amount at all. Note: For Buy on Google, any item listed below the minimum order price will be disapproved in Merchant Center. Contact Google before configuring a minimum order value. Learn more about setting up shipping and taxes for Buy on Google This article explains how to add a minimum order value to your shipping settings. How it works Depending on your shipping service, you might require that customers spend a minimum amount on your site before you’re able to ship their products. If the minimum order value is higher than what you charge for any of the products you submit to Merchant Center, then you’ll also need to submit that minimum order value through your shipping settings. Customers will see this value on your ad so they know about shipping restrictions before going to your website. Being up front with this information prevents you from paying for clicks from people who aren’t intending to buy additional products. Even for countries where you’re not required to provide shipping cost, you’ll need to provide any minimum order value that you require. When it shows Customers won’t necessarily see the minimum order value on every one of your ads or free product listings. To understand when customers will see your minimum order value, keep in mind the following: The cheapest shipping cost from the available shipping services for a product will determine whether or not a minimum order value is shown. Customers will only see the minimum order value when the product’s price is lower than the minimum order value. Customers won’t see the minimum order value when the product’s price is equal to or greater than the minimum order value. Instructions For each shipping service that requires a minimum order value, add this value (for example, 30 USD) in the Advanced settings field during setup. If only certain products are affected, you can apply a minimum order value to only those products with a shipping label: First for each product that’s affected, use the shipping label [shipping_label] attribute. Then when setting up your shipping settings, filter products by that shipping label. If the minimum order value can vary by customer (depending on their membership in a program, the time of their last order, etc.), provide the minimum order value that would allow customers to get their order shipped.

Do not confuse the dates you see in the examples in this guide with the actual current term dates and information. Step 1 — Academic advising Academic advising The requirements for advising prior to registration vary according to your program of study. To determine if you require advising refer to the Holds box on your Student Center page or go to your Faculty or School’s advising information page by clicking on the appropriate link below. How to contact your academic advisor: In most cases, you will be assigned an academic advisor for your main plan of study and potentially for any additional plans that you may have. You can easily see the advisor information from the homepage of your student centre: This displays the name of your individual advisor or advising team along with their contact telephone number (if available). If you click on the “details” link, you will see a breakdown of which advisor or advising team relates to each of your plans. If available, and depending on the email program you are using, you can click on the link where the name of the advisor or advising team is shown. This will allow you to email your advisor. If there is no link, then no email address has been provided and you should use the contact phone number to reach your advisor. NOTE: If you are using an internet email client such as Gmail, you can hover the cursor over the link and the email address will be displayed in the bottom left of your screen. Alternatively, depending on the browser you are using, you can right-click on the link and select ‘copy email address’. You may then paste the address into your email client. You can also get more information about advising from the links below:    »  Arts and Science    »  John Molson School of Business    »  Engineering and Computer Science    »  Fine Arts    »  Independent students Step 2 — Accessing registration Register for courses. You can also find the link to register on to the Student Hub's My CU Account page. If you are on a mobile device or a tablet, click the Enroll tile to begin your registration process. If you are using a desktop, you can access the enrolment functions from the left-hand navigation Enrollment dropdown or by clicking on Enroll on the right. Step 3 — Plan your timetable To assist you in planning your timetable we have included information on how to look for courses three different ways: A – Use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder The Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule. B – Use the Class Search You can search for a range of classes based on specific criteria you can define. C – Browse the Course Catalog This is a comprehensive listing of courses offered at Concordia University. Please note the following: Test Results If you plan on registering for English Composition or ESL (English as a Second Language) courses and have written the appropriate placement test, your results will be sent to you by e-mail. REQUISITES Pre-requisites – These are usually either specific classes you must have taken or a minimum amount of credits that you will need to have obtained before you can register for a given class. Co-requisites – These are classes that need to be taken at the same time (or previously) in order to be able to register for a given class. Anti-requisites – These are other classes for which you must not have previously received credit (including any transfer credit or exemptions) in order to be eligible to register for a given class. For example, MARK495 is an anti-requisite of MARK301. To register for MARK301, students should not have previously taken and received credit for MARK495. The reason for these types of requirements are to stop students taking courses out of sequence or taking a higher level course and then trying to take a lower level course that may have similar content. You should consult the Undergraduate Calendar to see the requisites for the course in which you want to register. If you receive a message about ‘requisites not met’ when trying to register for a class, you should ensure that you have met all of the requisites as stated in the Undergraduate Calendar. If you believe that you have then you will need to speak to your department (JMSB students, please contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office) so that they can look into this matter for you. Degree students: You are not permitted to register for a course that has a prerequisite if you have not completed that prerequisite. If you have received authorization from an academic advisor to register for a course without the stated prerequisite, the advisor must enter a waiver that will permit you access to the course. Independent/Visiting students: If you wish to register for courses where the prerequisite was completed elsewhere, you must complete a “Prerequisite Waiver Form” and receive approval prior to registering. Note that you must include specific details of the course, including the course name and number, where and when it was completed, as well as the course description and transcripts. This form is available at the Birks Student Service Centre.   RESERVE SEATS IN CLASSES Some classes have seats that are reserved for students in specific programs. This is usually done to ensure that students who need the class as part of their program are able to register for it. Depending on the rules defined by the department that offers the class, they may set all, some, or none of the seats to be reserved.  If you try to register for a class and receive a message about ‘reserved seats’ then you should select another class or consult the department or the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office, for JMSB students to obtain permission to take the class. DEPARTMENT CONSENT Some classes may require that you first obtain permission to take the class. If you receive a message that states: “Department Consent Required”, you will need to speak to the department that offers the class in order to obtain permission to register. JMSB students will need to contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office.          A — Use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder The Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule. Note that the tool does not register you for any courses but will allow you to add courses directly to your enrollment course cart. You will then need to follow the instructions further down this page in Step 6A – Adding Classes. You can access the Concordia Class Schedule Builder from four different places in your student centre: 1. Student Centre Homepage Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Click the “class schedule builder” link shown in the image below. 2. Class Search Page Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Click the “SEARCH FOR CLASSES” button on the top right of the page. On the Search for Classes page, click the “SEARCH WITH CLASS SCHEDULE BUILDER” button. 3. Enrollment Course Cart page Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Then either click the ‘Enroll’ or ‘enrollment course cart’ links. Then on the next page select the relevant term and click CONTINUE. Once in the enrollment course cart, select the ‘Class Schedule Builder’ option (shown below) and click ‘search’. 4. Class Schedule Page Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre.  Select the ‘Class Schedule’ option from the drop-down list in the Academics section.  Then on the next page select the relevant term and click CONTINUE. On the ‘My Class Schedule’ page, select the ‘View in Class Schedule Builder’ option at the top right. For more information about how to use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder, please watch the instructional video available on the Student Hub.          B — Use the class search The Search for classes function is used to look for information about scheduled classes for a particular term and is generally available in early March. A variety of search criteria may be entered to narrow or broaden a search. Search results provide information such as date and time of classes, location, name of instructor, number of seats available and so on. To search for classes: Select the desired term from the drop-down menu. Term Selection Example: For a Summer class, select “Summer 2021” For a Fall class, select “Fall 2021” For a Winter class, select “Winter 2022” For a Fall / Winter class, select “Fall/Winter 2021-22” (6 credit FULL YEAR classes only) To view classes in all terms of the academic year, select “ALL TERMS (2021-2022) NOTE: Any terms in the list that end in “(CCE Only)” will only return results for Continuing Education classes. Enter search criteria into open fields: Conduct a basic search by entering information into the fields displayed under Class Search Criteria (see Basic Search Criteria table below for more information), or Conduct an advanced search by clicking the Additional Search Criteria fields (see Advanced Search Criteria table below for more information). NOTE: You must enter or select a minimum of two search criteria (in addition to the term selection).   Use the CLEAR button to clear information from the fields and enter new search criteria. Click the SEARCH button to retrieve results. View information returned on the Search Results page: If you are searching in a term in which you have already enrolled, your “My Class Schedule” will be displayed. A summary of the search criteria entered List of classes that meet the search criteria, including class details, class name and number, section, location, days, times, instructor, term offered, availability, and status. New search criteria can be entered by clicking the NEW SEARCH or MODIFY SEARCH button If a class in the search results is offered in a career and term that you are active in, then you will be able to use the “select” button next to the class to add it to your Course Cart. For example, if you are in an undergraduate program but search for a graduate class, the select button will not appear. If you are already enrolled in a class or a class is already in your enrollment course cart, the “select” button will not appear.   BASIC SEARCH CRITERIA Term The “Term” drop down refers to the term for which you are searching for class(es). Course Career The “Course Career” drop-down menu allows you to select if you want to search for classes offered to Undergraduates, Graduates, Professional Development (GradProSkills), Research, or classes in Continuing Education. Select Subject The green “select subject” button provides an alphabetical listing of all class subjects that have been offered historically (these may not currently be offered). If you already know the abbreviation of the Class Subject, type it into the blank field beside the “select subject” button. For example, type “ENGL” for English classes, or “FINA” for Finance classes. Course Number The “Course Number” field narrows the search down further to a specific class. For example, if you want to search for the POLI 202 class, you would enter “POLI” in the ‘Select Subject’ field above and then enter “202” into the ‘Course Number’ field. Course Level The “Course Level” field allows you to search for classes at a specific level. You can select multiple levels if you wish to view a larger range of results. For example, if you want to view all 200-level classes, select the “200” checkbox. If you want to view all 500 and 600-level classes, select both the “500” and “600” checkboxes. NOTE: The Course Level option can only be used for credit courses. This can be combined with the ‘Select subject’ field or the ‘Department or Faculty’ field to refine results. Department or Faculty The “Department or Faculty” field allows you to search for classes offered by a specific department or faculty. For example, to search for classes offered by the Education department, select “Education” from the drop-down menu. To search for classes offered by the Fine Arts faculty, select “FACULTY OF FINE ARTS” from the drop-down menu. NOTE: When searching for classes offered by a Faculty, you may have to refine your search by selecting additional criteria. . ADDITIONAL SEARCH CRITERIA Class Times The “Class Times” field refers to the class start and end times. Entering a time in the first field will search for all classes starting after the time entered. Entering a time in the second field will search for all classes ending before the time entered. These fields can be used together to search for classes within a desired range. NOTE: The times should be entered in a 24-hour format. For example, if you wish to search for 7am, enter “07.00”, or for 7pm, enter “19.00”. Days of the week You can select any of the checkboxes next to the relevant day(s) of the week to include classes offered on that day in the search. NOTE: If you select a specific day, the search results will include classes that are scheduled on that day, including any classes that are split between the selected day and another day. For example, if you select the “Mon” checkbox only, you will see classes scheduled on a Monday only and classes scheduled on a Monday and Wednesday. Location You can use the “Location” field to search for any combination of ‘in-person’ classes scheduled at the ‘Sir George Williams (Downtown)’ or ‘Loyola’ campuses, or for ‘Online Courses. NOTE: If you search only for Online classes, then any Class Times entered or Days of Week selected will be ignored. Instructor Last Name Search for classes taught by a specific instructor by entering the first few letters, the exact last name, or letters contained in the name. Course Keyword Search for a class by its title and description. Enter a full or partial keyword to return search results that include all classes with the keyword or partial keyword as part of the title or description. Class Nbr Enter the ‘Class Nbr’ if known. This is a 4 or 5-digit class number that a class is assigned in the Student Information System. NOTE: This is not the same number as the “Course Number” field above. Mode of Instruction There are three modes of instruction at Concordia: In Person – In Person courses are taught in-person on a Concordia campus. On-Line – On-line courses are taught online and not in a classroom setting. Blended Learning – Blended Learning courses are a combination of in-class and online learning. Class times, locations and specific dates listed in Days/Times and Start/End Date fields will indicate which in-class meetings are required. For more information, please see the notes tab or contact the department.          C — Browse course catalog The Browse Course Catalog feature provides access to a comprehensive listing of information about courses offered at Concordia University.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Search > Browse Course Catalog To browse for courses: Course List provides the opportunity to look for a particular course subject by selecting the first letter of the subject of the course: Selecting a letter brings up a list of matching course subjects. Selecting a particular course subject will display a list of courses available. Important Note:  the existence of a course on this list does not guarantee that the course is currently offered. If you click on the “Course Nbr” or “Course Title” column you will be able to see the course details: The Course Detail page will identify whether or not the course has been scheduled. If it is scheduled, you will be able to “view class sections” to learn how many sections are available and when they are offered. If a course does not have a description, please refer to the undergraduate academic calendar for further details regarding the course. Selecting the View Class Sections link displays the term in which you are considering taking the course and you can see whether or not it is being offered. Step 4 — Enrollment appointment dates The enrollment appointment date is the first date on which you may begin the registration process for that term. Your individual date will be displayed in the Enrollment Dates box on your Student Center page. Example: Although the enrollment appointment dates indicate when you will be able to start registering, you can start planning and filling your Course Cart in early March.  The enrollment appointment date is based on the number of credits to completion for your program if you are a degree student. If you wish to calculate your enrollment appointment date, the following formula is used: Program length (minimum credits required) minus credits earned minus in progress courses as of February 2019 (excluding DISC courses) equals credits to completion. Following are all the enrollment appointment dates for 2021-22: Enrollment appointment dates Summer 2021 (term number 2211) Fall 2021 (term number 2212) Fall/Winter 2021 - 22 (term number 2213) Winter 2022 (term number 2214)   Enrollment Appointment Date Credits to completion or category of student March 9 0 to 9 credits + COOP Students, Varsity Students March 10 10 to 21 credits March 11 22 to 33 credits March 12 34 to 42 credits March 15 43 to 54 credits March 16 55 to 63 credits March 17 64 to 72 credits March 18 73 to 87 credits March 19 88 and more credits March 22 Visiting undergraduate students, returning and newly authorized undergraduate Independent students for Summer 2021 (term number 2211) April 20 Visiting Students – for Fall / Winter April 20 Newly admitted undergraduate students registering for Fall 2021 (term number 2212), Fall/Winter 2021-22 (term number 2213) and Winter 2022 (term number 2214) terms Students admitted for Fall 2021 (term number 2212) should register for Fall 2021 (term number 2212) and Winter 2022 (term number 2214) courses at the same time. August 2 Returning and newly authorized undergraduate Independent students for Fall 2021 (term number 2212). September 21 New undergraduate students admitted for Winter 2022 (term number 2214) can register any time after admission and advising criteria have been satisfied November 25 Newly authorized undergraduate Independent students for Winter 2022 (term number 2214) Step 5 — System availability On the enrollment appointment dates, the system is programmed to be available from 8 a.m. onward. The registration system may be extremely busy at 8 a.m. on each new enrollment appointment date. Step 6 — Registration While departmental and faculty advisors and staff are always available to give advice and guidance, you are responsible for the completeness and correctness of your course selection and registration, and for observing the University’s regulations and deadlines.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > My Academics If the information concerning your program is incorrect you may contact 514-848-2424, ext. 2668 to find out how to make corrections. It is important for this information to be correct, as the wrong degree or concentration may block you from entering courses for which you are eligible. Address Verification – On the Student Center page, you will see your current address. If you need to correct your address or any other piece of personal information, click on the relevant area under the Personal Information banner and you will be redirected to another screen where you can make the necessary changes. Please note that you are responsible for providing the University with your current mailing and e-mail address. You are required to fulfill all financial and administrative obligations within the prescribed deadlines regardless of the validity of your address in our files. Student Hub > Get to know your self-service portal          A — Adding classes You can add classes to your schedule for the selected term in three easy steps with a couple of restrictions to note: If you have a financial hold you will not be able to register in classes until you clear the hold. Classes can only be added until the add/drop deadline for a given term. For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Add Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection. Click the Continue button.   Find a class to add, using one of the options displayed, or, if you know the class number, enter it into the Enter Class Nbr field Class Schedule Builder – refer to Step 3 A – Use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder above if you need further help. Class Search – refer to Step 3 B – Use the Class Search above if you need further help. To view details of the course, click on the Section to obtain further information about the course. If satisfied that you wish to enroll in this course, choose “select”. Confirm the class information. If the section selected also requires you to register for additional components such as labs, tutorials, conferences, etc. you will be required to make that choice before proceeding further: Once you have selected the conference, press Next.  You will receive confirmation that the course has been added to your Course Cart. NOTE: Having a course added to your Course Cart does not mean that you are registered in the course. You must click on ‘Proceed to Step 2 of 3’ OR  ‘enroll’ in order to go to the final confirmation page. At this point, you may continue to add further courses to your Course Cart. Once you have added all your required courses, you will need to click on the “Proceed To Step 2 of 3” button. If your registration was successful you will see the following message: If it was unsuccessful you will receive an error explaining what the problem is and what you must do to rectify the situation. Here is just one possible example: For Example, the above message is informing you that Departmental Consent is required before you can register in this course. It would be necessary for you to contact the relevant Department to obtain the necessary consent. In other instances, you may be denied registration in a course that appears to have seats available. This is caused by the Department/Faculty having reserved seats for students in a particular department or program of study. Remember to register for all terms Summer (2191), Fall (2192), Fall/Winter (2193) and Winter (2194) at the same time – do not wait until later in the Fall to register for your Winter courses as you may find them filled to capacity.          B — Dropping classes Please note: If you only want to change sections of the same course see Step 6, C – Swapping classes. There are three easy steps to dropping a class from your schedule but there are two different types of course withdrawals and both are controlled by deadline dates shown in the Term Dates and Deadlines. Please note the following important details: DNE – did not enter – The DNE date is generally one to two weeks after the first day of classes. A withdrawal (drop) before the DNE deadline date is treated as if you were never in the course. There will be no entry on your student record for that course and you will not be charged tuition and other fees for that course. If you have already paid for the course, you will receive financial credit for course fees. DISC – discontinue – The DISC date is later in the term. A withdrawal (drop) after the DNE date, but before the DISC deadline date allows you to stop attending that course with no academic penalty. Unlike the DNE, however, the course will remain on your student record with an entry of DISC and you will be held financially responsible for the payment of 100% of tuition and other fees, including the Winter portion of a full-year course. Not attending classes, or informing an instructor of an intent to withdraw, does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does it entitle a student to a refund of fees or cancellation of registration. Without formally dropping the course by the appropriate academic withdrawal deadline, non-attendance of a class will result in the assignment of a failing grade. If you enroll in a fall term course that is a prerequisite for a winter course and later drop the fall course, the Faculty/Department involved will run a process at the beginning of the winter term to ensure that all students registered in a course with prerequisites have successfully completed that prerequisite. Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed, you will not have the option to select that term. If you have a financial hold, you will be able to drop classes, but you will not be able to add classes. If you intend to replace a dropped class with a new class, ensure that all financial holds are cleared. For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Drop NOTE: If you receive an error message stating “You are not authorized for self service enrollment at this time” when you click on the Drop tab, you will need to click the “change term” button and then follow the steps below. Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table. Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection from the table. Click the Continue button. All registered classes for the term will be displayed in a grid. Multi-component classes will display all registered sections. Select the class(es) you want to drop and click the Drop Selected Classes button. Note that you are able to drop multiple courses at once if you wish to do so. Select the My class Schedule button to retrieve your class schedule and confirm that the class(es) are no longer shown OR if they are, that they correctly show the status as Dropped or DSC.          C — Swapping classes (including Section changes) You can swap one course for another or one section for a different one. The process is a combination of add and drop. The swap function allows you to verify the availability of another course or section of the same course before you make a decision. There is, therefore, no risk of losing the section you have if another section is not available.  DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, use the drop and add features to accomplish a section change. If you drop the section that you are currently registered for and then find out that no spaces are available in other sections, you may not be able to get back into the section you were originally registered in as another student may have taken your place once you dropped the course. There are some restrictions attached to swapping classes: If you have a financial hold you will not be able to swap any classes until you clear the hold. Classes can only be swapped until the add/drop deadline for a given term.  For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page. If you are not enrolled in any classes you will not have access to swap classes. The swap feature should not be used to swap between summer classes in different summer sessions. For example, do not use it to swap from a May to June course into a June to August course or from a full summer (May to August) course into either a May to June course or a June to August course. To swap a component of a multi-component class while keeping one or more of the other components (for example, swap HIST 202 Lec A, Conf AA for HIST 202 Lec A, Conf BB while keeping the same lecture) see the section entitled Swapping Multi-Component Classes.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Swap Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table. Click the Continue button. The first grid on this page called, Swap This Class, displays a list of classes in which you are currently enrolled. The next section, called With This Class, allows you to search for a class using the class search feature, or to select from your Course Cart, or to enter the Class Nbr if you already know it. Select the class that you wish to swap from with the Swap This Class grid. Select the class that you want to swap to using the With This class grid. If you use the search feature and identify a course, you will be asked to choose the section you want by using the “select class” button and you are then re-directed to the Confirm your selection page. If you Select from your Course Cart, using the select button next to that option takes you to the Confirm your selection page. If you use the Enter Class Nrb feature and press enter you will eventually reach the Confirm your selection page. Confirm your selection and click the Finish Swapping button. If the swap is unsuccessful either follow the instructions in the error message or try another course by selecting SWAP from the menu bar: View My Class Schedule to verify the status of your swap transaction: Swapping multi-component classes (while keeping one or more of the other components) Search for the class using the search function in the With this class grid. You will be prompted to make a selection for all required components even if you want to keep the same sections in which you are already enrolled. Confirm your selection. All related components of a class will be displayed. Verify the swap transaction. View My Class Schedule to ensure that the class has been swapped in your registration. PLEASE NOTE – If you try to swap one of your components for another one that is currently on a waitlist, then you will be placed on the waitlist for ALL components of the class and potentially lose your place in the class. If you do not want to take this risk, then do not use the swap feature to swap components if your preferred component is on a waitlist. For example: You are currently enrolled in COMP248 Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X. You want to stay in Lecture U and Laboratory UI-X, but swap the tutorial for U UB (which is on a waitlist). If you attempt to do this using a swap, you will lose your existing places in Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X and be placed on the waitlist for Lecture U, Tutorial U UB and Laboratory UI-X.          D — Wait listing classes Once all seats in a course have been filled it may still be possible for you to add your name to a wait list. Academic departments have the choice of offering wait list seats or not. To determine which courses will allow you to add your name to a wait list:    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Search Select the term Select the subject Select the course number Search Once the results of the search are displayed, click on the Section hyperlink: You are now on the Class Detail page which indicates whether or not a Wait List is available for the course selected and it is also indicated what the wait list capacity is for the course and the Wait List total. This tells you that 80 students can add their name to a wait list after the class capacity of 770 has been reached. There are two scenarios under which you may add your name to a wait list. You have not yet enrolled in your maximum course load so that if a seat becomes available you would be eligible to add it to your other courses for that term. You have enrolled in your maximum course load but you set-up your name on a wait list using the swap feature so that if a seat does become available, you would swap one course for another. Scenario 1 You start the registration process by trying to register for ECON 201 but the course is full and you get the following error message: You use the class search described above to see the detail of the course and determine that a wait list is available and that there is still room for you to add your name. Knowing this, you select the course again and tick the box labelled Wait list if class is full and select next. You will see the resulting message: If a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be registered automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty. Scenario 2 If you are permitted to enroll in 15 credits in the fall term and you have already reached that capacity but still want the possibility of entering INTE 123, you would use the Swap This Class grid to identify which of your courses you would swap. You would then go to the With This Class grid and enter the course. You will then follow the normal steps to get to the point where you identify that you want to “Wait list if class is full”. If a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be swapped from one course to the other automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty. Some tips about wait lists You can wait list for a maximum of 6 units per term. You cannot be wait listed for two sections of the same course. You can remove your name from a wait list by using the drop feature. Note: Adding your name to a waitlist does NOT guarantee that you will get into the class. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are on a waitlist for a course, it does not mean that you are actually registered for the course. You will only be registered into the course if a seat becomes available and the system registers you into the class based on your waitlist position. Step 7 — Verify your courses You can verify your schedule in two different formats. From your Student Center page you can choose weekly schedule. The resulting “My Class Schedule” page allows you to select the term for which you wish to verify your registrations. After selecting the term, press continue. You then have the choice of seeing your schedule in a list view or a weekly calendar view. The list view is as follows: The weekly calendar view is as follows: PLEASE NOTE: The weekly calendar view of your class schedule will not show any classes that occur on a national or university holiday. Any online classes that you are enrolled in will appear at the bottom of the calendar.   The Concordia Class Schedule Builder view is as below: Once you have selected the term in the Concordia Class Schedule Builder, you will see the classes that you are enrolled in, are on the waitlist for, or have in your enrollment course cart. Step 8 — How to obtain help If you encounter faculty-related difficulties (prerequisites, co-requisites, anti-requisites; permission of the department required; closed class, etc.) while using the Registration system, you must contact your department. Please refer to the following links:    »  Arts and Science    »  John Molson School of Business    »  Engineering and Computer Science    »  Fine Arts For non Faculty-related problems, please call 514-848-2424, ext. 2668 Monday to Friday, from 09:00 – 17:00, all year round, except for holidays. Should you experience technical difficulties, please contact the Concordia Service Desk at: By phone: 514-848-2424, ext. 7613 Via email at: help@concordia.ca By opening a ticket Please note that the Service Desk cannot assist you directly with any issues you are having registering for classes. You should contact your advisor or department or, for JMSB students, the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office initially and they will then contact the Service Desk on your behalf if it is an issue they are unable to resolve. Step 9 — Obtain your account balance and verify payment deadlines Information regarding your account balance is available from the Student Center page under the Finances banner: Payment Deadlines: Due Now – this is the amount that you owe for the tuition and fees for the current term. An amount may show as ‘Due now’ before the final payment deadline. For example, the tuition fees for a Fall term are generally due at the beginning of September but you are allowed until the end of September to pay them without financial penalty. These fees will show as ‘Due Now’ in your Student Centre from the beginning of September. Future Due – this is the amount that you will have to pay for the upcoming term(s), including tuition and fees for classes you have enrolled in for any upcoming term(s). For example, if you are enrolling in Winter classes before the beginning of January, the tuition fees for these classes will show as ‘Future Due’ in your Student Centre until the beginning of January.   PLEASE NOTE – if you have recently enrolled or dropped some classes and you would like to see your updated tuition balance, you can click on the “Account Inquiry” link in the top-left of the Finances section.  This will trigger a recalculation of your tuition fees and update your balance accordingly.

Parking is generally paid on major thoroughfares and shopping streets. In some sectors, parking spaces are reserved for residents if they have a permit.You can park on the street in many neighbourhoods, which makes it easier to get around by car. However, you need to pay attention to signage: parking in some places is prohibited, or reserved for permit holders.  Reserved parking zones To make sure that parking spaces are fairly distributed, some sectors are reserved for permit holders. Parking permits are made available to residents. Car-sharing organizations such as Communauto can also get them, as well as workers in some cases. Daily and monthly permits are provided in some sectors. Parking permits are issued by boroughs. Motorbikes Free parking for motorcyclists is available from April 1 to October 31. Located in the downtown core, these reserved parking zones are identified by a sign that reads “Stationnement interdit excepté motos.”View the map (in French)Parking meter network  On major thoroughfares and shopping streets, you will usually have to pay for on-street parking. Check the pay station to find out the rate. You can pay at automated pay stations or by using the mobile application. In Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, some areas have parking meters with a yellow “P.” Parking is by the hour or by the day. Disabled parking This type of parking is a 6-metre zone marked off by signs on a public road. It does not belong to the person who applies for it and may be used by anyone who has a disabled parking permit from the Société d’assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ). If you need a parking space for someone with a handicap, you must apply to the city for one.  Disabled passenger drop-off zone The 2-metre drop-off zone is a prohibited parking area. It allows a disabled passenger to get into or out of a vehicle more safely. Organizations that want to improve access to their buildings may also submit an application, as may the parents of a child with reduced mobility.Until January 2, 2022, on-street parking in spaces that are usually paid is free of charge on weeknights from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. and on Saturdays and Sundays in Ville-Marie.Politique de stationnement (in French) [PDF 1 MB]Stationnement pour personne handicapée Ce stationnement est une zone de 6 mètres délimitée par des panneaux. Comme il se situe sur la voie publique, il n’appartient pas au demandeur et peut être utilisé par tous les détenteurs de la vignette pour personnes handicapées de la SAAQ.  Si vous avez besoin d’un stationnement pour personne handicapée, vous devez déposer une demande à la Ville.  Débarcadère pour passager handicapé Le débarcadère est une zone de stationnement interdit de 2 mètres. Cette zone permet à tout passager handicapé de monter à bord d’un véhicule ou d’en descendre de façon plus sécuritaire. Les organisations qui désirent favoriser l’accessibilité de leur immeuble peuvent également présenter une demande tout comme les parents d’un enfant à mobilité réduite.Information and

Increasing fiber in the diet is one lifestyle treatment approach.  Learn more about fiber. Yakima fruit paste is a ""constipation jam"" that is served in hospitals and hospices to help patients with their severe constipation. However, you can easily make it at home and get the same benefits. Yakima fruit paste recipe You can divide this recipe in half if you want, as it makes a large amount. The fruit paste stays fresh in freezer indefinitely. Ingredients ½ pound (225 grams) prunes             ½ pound (225 grams) raisins       ½ pound (225 grams) dried figs     ½ cup (125 ml) brown sugar (optional; don't use or use less) 2 ounces senna tea leaves or enough tea bags to be close enough (close enough is good enough) ½ cup lemon juice Instructions 1. Prepare tea. Use about 1½ cups boiled water added to tea and steep five minutes. 2. Strain tea to remove tea leaves. Add 1 cup of tea to a pan and then add fruit. 3. Boil fruit and tea for five minutes. 4. Remove from heat and add sugar and lemon juice. Allow to cool. 5. Use hand mixer or food processor to stir fruit mixture into smooth paste. Use leftover tea to loosen it up as needed. 6. Place in plastic container and place in freezer (paste will not harden). 7. Spoon out what you require each day. Dose: 1 to 2 tablespoons per day for a few days while you implement the other constipation management strategies listed above. Enjoy eating fruit paste straight off the spoon, spread it on toast or add hot water and make a drink. If the fruit paste is not working (no bowel movements), then increase the amount of fruit paste each day. If the fruit paste induces very loose stools, cut down on the amount of fruit paste intake. Consider taking it every other day. Contraception (birth control) The Making Decisions about Birth Control article from the MyHealthMatters lists questions to ask yourself when choosing a birth control method. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada website has information on contraceptive options. They created the It's a plan section ""to help you and your health care provider determine the method that’s best for you."" What to do if I missed a pill? If you have missed a dose of your hormonal contraceptive you should consult the package insert for the brand of pills that you are taking. Stay on Schedule is also a good tool to help decide what the next step is. Alternatively, you can call Info Santé at 8-1-1 (24/7, free) to speak with a nurse. Your pharmacist can also assist you. Emergency contraception Emergency contraception refers to measures taken shortly after intercourse to prevent pregnancy. These measures are not to be used as a regular method for contraception; rather they are meant to be used in emergency situations such as condom breakage, missed birth control pills or non-consensual sexual intercourse.   In Canada, two options are available for emergency contraception: Plan B and Ella.  Both contain hormones and require a prescription. You can get a prescription at Concordia Health Services and purchase it at any pharmacy.  At CLSC Metro (one block from Concordia SGW campus) you can receive Plan B for free with a valid RAMQ card, and for a fee with out-of-province and international student health plans. You can also purchase emergency contraception from a pharmacist: there will be no additional consultation fee for people with a valid RAMQ card, and there will be a small additional cosultation fee for people with out-of-province and international student health plans. Non-hormonal contraception Some people prefer a form of contraception that does not contain hormones. Learn more about your options by exploring the SOGC's Non-Hormonal Methods and Natural Methods pages. Some of these options are a bit more difficult to access, so we've listed a few sources; these are not the only sources, but a place to start. Female condoms can be ordered online from condom specialty shops; this one has free shipping. Caya® diaphragm doesn't requrie fitting, so it can be ordered online.   The Sponge and FemCap reusable cervical cap are currently unavailable. Fertility Awareness Method (FAM) and Natural Family Planning (NFP) Fertility awareness and natural birth control methods teach the woman to identify the fertile time of her menstrual cycle. The couple can then avoid unprotected vaginal sex during the fertile time. The sympto-thermal approach, where the woman tracks her temperature and cervical mucus, is considered the most effective of all the natural birth control methods. You need to thoroughly learn the method and practice it correctly in order for it to work the way it was meant to...but this is true of any form of contraception. Explore this online guide to get a thorough overview; the content was developed by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Display URLs give people an idea of where they'll arrive after they click an ad. The landing page that you define with a final URL tends to be more specific. For example, if your display URL is www.example.com, your final URL might be example.com/sweaters. For expanded text ads, your display URL consists of the domain of your final URL (and the subdomain, if you have one) and your two optional “Path” fields of up to 15 characters each. Google constantly makes changes to Google Ads. As a result, Google may update the domain component of your display URL. Your display URL may appear in your ad with a ""www."" prefix in lowercase letters (even if you enter it with capitalized letters). If your URL begins with a subdomain, your display URL may include it (for example, the support in support.google.com). Your display URL may appear in your ad with an ""http://"" or “https://” prefix on Google.com, depending on the protocol scheme of the final URL.

And there are moments when a patient gets better.’ November 4, 2020 | By Ursula Leonowicz, BA 97, with files from Joseph Leger, BA 15 Source: University Advancement While health-care workers are trained to handle acute stress, few could have adequately prepared for an event like the pandemic of 2020. With scant experience to draw on since the outset of COVID-19, and with the long-term effects of the disease still hazy, hospital staff have had to concurrently mobilize to care for the infected and confront the threat of exposure. For many, the task has exacted a severe toll. We spoke to two Concordia alumnae on the health-care front lines — Natalie Cousineau, BSc 96, and Emilie Casselle, BA 07 — to find out how they have coped with the challenges of the novel coronavirus, both personally and professionally. Natalie Cousineau: emergency physician As a staff emergency physician at a Barrie, Ontario area hospital, Natalie Cousineau is on duty 24-7. The exercise science graduate says that the unknowns associated with COVID-19 are what pose so much difficulty. “It came on the scene as a very unpredictable disease. For many of us, it was the first time in ages that we were working 10 hours and then coming home to read for another three. Things were changing so fast, especially at the beginning. It was an exercise in flexibility and thinking on your feet, but on a completely different level.” Another hurdle Cousineau had to overcome was how to best balance patient care with the need to self-protect and protect others, whether non-COVID patients or family members at home. “I know a lot of colleagues — single moms — who sent their kids to live with relatives when this first started,” she says. “They either lost their childcare or couldn’t go to work, because of contagion concerns.” Cousineau is thankful her two children, aged 10 and 12, are old enough to be aware of the pandemic but not so old that the enormity of the crisis overwhelms them. “We sent them to live with relatives, but when my husband and I realized this was going to be a marathon and not a sprint, we brought them home. I make sure to go through a very extensive decontamination after every shift.” ‘It’s our job’ Cousineau has felt cheered — and somewhat bemused — by the moral support directed at health-care workers since the start of the pandemic. A note was recently left on her doorstep that read: “Thank you for the work that you do. And thank you for putting yourself out there on our behalf.” “It feels kind of awkward to accept that kind of praise,” she says. “Most of us have been doing this behind the scenes for so many years because it’s our job. Practically speaking, what would be most appreciated is having the personal protective equipment and tangible support that we need.” To help meet that demand, volunteers have stepped up at the hospital where Cousineau works. “They’re sewing us masks and surgical caps. The masks are really just for staff to take home, to use when we go out in public or with our families, but it’s so nice to not even have to think about it. “It’s very heartwarming. It feels like we’re supported and like everyone is behind us.” Emilie Casselle: nurse clinician Under normal circumstances, Emilie Casselle spends her work hours in the surgery department of a cardiac unit at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Since the onset of COVID-19, however, the nurse clinician and human relations grad has supported a number of other units as needed. “It changes all the time and that’s something that I’ve heard echoed from health-care workers generally,” says Casselle. “We’re having to be a lot more adaptable and flexible than before. “We don’t always know where we’re going to work on any particular day. It might be a COVID unit, an ambulatory care unit or a general floor. The lack of predictability about what our work is going to look like has been a big thing to deal with.” Because of her risk for exposure, Casselle has not been able to see any friends or family for quite some time. “I haven’t seen my mother since this started. Health-care workers are showing up to work and putting their patients first, which is incredible, because everybody has their own home life or situation that they might be worried about. I’m really impressed and in awe of colleagues that continue to do that.” ‘I’ve surrendered to not knowing what the future holds’ Though the pandemic has compelled health-care workers like Casselle to face a new and uncertain reality, the alumna — with an assist from her online yoga community — has adopted a mindful approach. “I’ve surrendered to not knowing what the future holds and not knowing what’s going to happen beyond this shift. I’ve been able to live a lot more in the present and that’s been a positive thing. “There are moments when you want to cry, during and after work. And then there are moments when a patient gets better. I was on a COVID unit the other day and was able to talk to a couple of patients about discharging them. That gives you hope.” Casselle also hopes the pandemic spurs calls to provide essential workers with better pay and more security. “There are people working minimum wage jobs who are exposing themselves to tremendous risk. Praise is great but what are we as a society going to do to support them?” Related topics 	 human sciences 	 	 community 	 	 COVID-19 	 	 alumni 	 	 exercise 	 You might also like: Concordia MD ‘My inspiration and passion are in helping people’ ‘Go out there and make a difference’ Trending November 30: Join the global Giving Tuesday movement ‘Concordia gave me everything, even language’ ‘Your support changed my life’ Back to top © Concordia University Concordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424 About Academics Admissions Campus life Research International Careers Future students Current students Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Sir George Williams Campus 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W.

The charter, which is supported by our external partners (the STM, the Commission des services électriques de Montréal, Énergir, Bell, Hydro-Québec, etc.), aims to support mobility, keep the public safe and limit construction nuisances. The quality of people’s lives and our city’s economic vitality depend on it.  Tangible commitments This chart has three levers for which the city and its external partners have made tangible commitments that they intend to carry out on an ongoing basis:  Accessibility, safety and mobility Impact management and mitigation measures Communications The environment   Here are some of the city’s commitments around these four levers:  Ensure pedestrian mobility and accessibility through safe corridors. Ensure that signs do not block pedestrians’ path and that street furniture (electric pools, street lamps, etc.) are used to install signage whenever possible. 	  Increase efforts to cover or remove orange cones and signage at the end of a project.  Make sure that signs that limit parking are installed between 12 and 14 hours before the construction project begins. Make sure that no parking periods are clearly indicated and correspond to times during which there is activity on the construction site.

If your ad shows on a mobile device with your app installed and a user clicks the link, it sends people directly to the content in your app. App Links and Universal Links: These links use your existing HTTP destination URL, such as www.example.com or www.example.com/product_1234. Tracking parameters are allowed for these links. Note: Deep links are not automatically set up when you create your app, and they work differently on iOS and Android. Learn about setting up custom schemes for Android apps Learn more about Universal Links for iOS apps Learn about setting up App Links for Android apps   How deep links appear Deep links are usually made up of two parts: a scheme and a host and path. App URIs, which are reformatted deep links, include a 3rd part: the app package ID. Your URL may also include a tracking parameter. The app package ID is the unique identifier for your app. Many developers create a package ID using the app’s internet domain in reverse. For example, apps published by Google start with ""com.google"". The scheme is a part of the link that identifies which app to open. For your app, you can use “http” or a custom scheme that can start with the app or website name. Host and path specify the unique location in the app where your content exists. For your app, you’ll designate the place people will go when they click your ad, or what should happen when your app opens.   Deep link App URI Definition Deep links specify a location in an app that corresponds to the content you’d like to show. App URI is a format of the deep link that helps integrate your app with Google Search. You'll see this format when you edit your ads. Format {scheme}://{host_path} android-app://{package_id}/{scheme}/{host_path} Example exampleapp://productid_1234 android-app://com.example.android/exampleapp/productid_1234 More about how app engagement ads work More about setting up deep links on our developer website.

Use this attribute when the account shipping settings for your product are not defined in Merchant Center or when you need to override the shipping settings that you set up in Merchant Center, for example, if you need to override your shipping settings for bulky or fragile products. The shipping [shipping] attribute is not available for use with Buy on Google. Shipping price must be set up at the account-level in Merchant Center. Learn more about setting up shipping for Buy on Google Shipping covers the cost charged by a shipping carrier or other costs directly related to shipping. A charge is considered to be a shipping cost if it’s described by the words ""handling"", ""delivery"", ""shipping"", ""logistics"", or ""carrier"". Shipping can include cross-border charges if the cost is included under a shipping term on your website. Shipping should also include insurance costs related to any of the 5 terms above. Shipping also covers speed, or the time from when a customer places an order to when they receive it. Shipping speed includes both handling time (sometimes referred to as processing time) and transit time. Handling time is the time from when an order is placed to when it is handed off to the shipping carrier. Transit time is the time from when an order has been handed off to a shipping carrier to when the customer receives it. Shipping speed and cost are the most common reasons for users abandoning their shopping choices, so showing accurate information can help the performance of your ads and free listings. The shipping [shipping] attribute can also be used to specify the countries to which your product ships for programs that don’t require shipping costs. When to use Not available for Buy on Google Shipping costs are required for free enhanced listings. They can be provided via the shipping [shipping] attribute or an account-level shipping service. Learn more about setting up shipping services Shipping costs are required for Shopping ads for any of the following countries: Australia Austria Belgium Canada Czechia France Germany Ireland Israel Italy Japan The Netherlands Poland South Korea Spain Switzerland The United Kingdom The United States Use this attribute to specify additional countries your product ships to. Also, use this attribute when shipping costs for your product aren't defined in Merchant Center or when you need to override the shipping settings that you set up in Merchant Center, such as for bulky or fragile products. This attribute uses sub-attributes to define country, delivery area, service, price, handling time, and transit time. These are the various sub-attributes: Country [country] (Required) The country that the product can be delivered to. Submit an ISO 3166-1 country code (for example: CH). Delivery area (Optional) To specify where your product can be delivered, submit one (and only one) of the following: Region [region] (Optional) Submit a state, territory, or prefecture. This is supported for the United States, Australia, and Japan. Submit a subdivision code from the ISO 3166-2 code tables (US, AU, or JP) without country prefix (for example, NY, NSW, 03). Postal code [postal_code] (Optional) Submit a postal code range. This is supported for the United States and Australia. Submit any of the following styles: A ZIP or postal code (for example: 94043) A range of postal codes (for example: 94002-95460) A range of postal codes using a prefix with a wildcard ( * ) (for example: , 94*) A range of postal codes using 2 prefixes with wildcards ( * ) (for example: 94*-95*) Location ID [location_id] (Optional) Submit a numeric criteria ID of your location defined by Google Ads API (AdWords API) (for example, for California use 21137). This is supported for the United States (state), Australia (state), and Japan (prefecture). Location group name [location_group_name] (Optional) Submit a location group that you set up and name through your Merchant Center settings. Use those group names here (for example: West Coast, Outback). This is supported for the United States and Australia. Learn more about setting up location groups Service [service] (Optional) Submit a service class or shipping speed. Price [price] (Required to provide shipping speed overrides, otherwise optional) Submit a fixed shipping cost, and use a period [.] as the decimal separator (for example: 3.00 USD). Avoid commas [,] to ensure that the price is interpreted correctly. Handling time (Optional) To specify how long a product may spend in handling submit the following sub-attributes: Minimum handling time [min_handling_time] The minimum number of days between when an order is placed and when it is handed off to a shipping carrier. Maximum handling time [max_handling_time] The maximum number of days between when an order is placed and when it is handed off to a shipping carrier. Refrain from using both the shipping sub-attributes for handling time and the standalone attributes for handling time. If both sets of attributes are provided for a product, the shipping sub-attributes will override standalone handling time attributes. The shipping sub-attributes are recommended for ads and free listings, while the standalone attributes are recommended for products sold through Buy on Google. Use business days. For example, if a customer orders on Tuesday and the shipment leaves the warehouse on Friday at the latest, the maximum handling time is 3 days. Transit time (Optional) To specify how long a product may spend in transit, submit the following sub-attributes: Minimum transit time [min_transit_time] The minimum number of days between when a product is handed off to a shipping carrier and when it is delivered to the customer. Maximum transit time [max_transit_time] The maximum number of days between when a product is handed off to a shipping carrier and when it is delivered to the customer. Note: In order for Google to calculate shipping speed, you must provide values for both the maximum handling time [max_handling_time] and the maximum transit time [max_transit_time] sub-attributes of the shipping [shipping] attribute. You must also submit a value for the shipping price [shipping_price] sub-attribute in order for your handling time and transit time sub-attributes to be considered valid. If you submit the shipping price [price] sub-attribute, the account shipping service settings (including shipping service delivery times and minimum order value) will be ignored for the matching location for that product. Format Follow these formatting guidelines to make sure Google understands the data you're submitting. For details on when and how to submit values in English, learn more about submitting your product data Type Unicode characters (Recommended: ASCII only) Supported values For AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, GBP, NZD, SGD, USD: 0-1000 For AED, BRL, CNY, DKK, HKD, ILS, MYR, NOK, PLN, SAR, SEK, TRY: 0-5000 For ARS, CZK, MXN, THB, TWD, UAH, ZAR: 0-20000 For INR, JPY, PHP, RUB: 0-100000 For KRW: 0-1000000 For HUF 0-300000 For CLP: 0-500000 For COP: 0-2000000 For IDR: 0-10000000 For VND: 0-20000000 Repeated field (What’s this?) Submit the shipping [shipping] attribute up to 100 times per product File format Example entry Text feeds Format the name by including which sub-attributes you’re submitting. Include shipping, and then, in parentheses, add the names of the sub-attributes that you want to submit separated by a colon ( : ). For example, to submit country, postal code, price, handling time, and transit time: Name shipping(country:postal_code:price:min_handling_time:max_handling_time: min_transit_time:max_transit_time) If you name the sub-attributes you are using, you can give them to us in any order. However, if you provide sub-attribute values but do not name them, we’ll assume that your attribute values include sub-attributes in this order: Country [country] Region [region] Service [service] Price [price] Format the value by submitting the value of each sub-attribute listed in the same order as in the name and separated with a colon ( : ). Don’t use quotation marks. For example: Name shipping(country:postal_code:price:min_handling_time:max_handling_time: min_transit_time:max_transit_time) Possible value US:80302:6.49 USD:1:3:2:5 To submit multiple locations, submit the attribute (with the same name) multiple times. For example: Name shipping(country:postal_code:price:min_handling_time:max_handling_time: min_transit_time:max_transit_time) Possible value US:94002-95460:0 USD:1:3:2:5 Name shipping(country:postal_code:price) Possible value US:900*-901*:15.99 USD If you don’t want to provide an optional sub-attribute for a particular product, then still add a colon ( : ), but leave the text blank. For example: Name shipping Possible value US:::6.49 USD Name shipping(country:region:price) Possible value US::6.49 USD XML feeds Include the optional sub-attributes if you need them. To specify a shipping cost for different delivery locations, submit the shipping [shipping] attribute multiple times including the relevant sub-attributes for each. <g:shipping>   <g:country>US</g:country>   <g:region>MA</g:region>   <g:service>Ground</g:service>   <g:price>6.49 USD</g:price>   <g:min_handling_time>1</g:min_handling_time>   <g:max_handling_time>3</g:max_handling_time>   <g:min_transit_time>2</g:min_transit_time>   <g:max_transit_time>5</g:max_transit_time> </g:shipping> <g:shipping>   <g:country>US</g:country>   <g:region>MA</g:region>   <g:service>Express</g:service>   <g:price>15.99 USD</g:price>   <g:min_handling_time>1</g:min_handling_time>   <g:max_handling_time>3</g:max_handling_time>   <g:min_transit_time>2</g:min_transit_time>   <g:max_transit_time>5</g:max_transit_time> </g:shipping> To format your data for Content API, see the Content API for Shopping. Learn more about the format requirements for repeated and/or group attributes in text feeds Learn more about the format requirements for repeated and/or group attributes in Google sheets Guidelines Follow these guidelines to make sure you submit high-quality data for your products. Minimum requirements These are the requirements you'll need to meet to show your product. If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in the Diagnostics page in your Merchant Center account. Submit complete and correct shipping information, including speed and costs. Shipping speed and cost are 2 of the most common reasons why shoppers abandon a product, so you’ll want to be sure that your shipping settings are accurate and up-to-date to make your ads and listings effective. Include all relevant shipping charges. Include all charges for a purchase that include the words ""shipping"", ""delivery"", ""handling"", ""logistics"", or ""carrier"". Overestimate if you can’t provide an accurate shipping cost. Match or overestimate the cost users would pay.Note that overestimating excessively may negatively impact your product performance. Use the rate for shipping directly to an individual. Don’t use other rates such as the rate for shipping to a store or a rate that requires a membership to be applicable. Display product details on your landing page to all users. Make sure a user who clicks your ad can see details about your product, even if you don’t ship to the user’s location. Comply with local laws when submitting shipping information. Best practices These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your product data for performance. Use account shipping settings in Merchant Center. With these settings you can create simple flat rates or complex, custom models. Use the shipping [shipping] attribute as a last resort to override the settings you create in Merchant Center. Submit a shipping price that can be represented in your country of sale’s currency (according to ISO 4217). For example, instead of 1.0012 USD, submit 1.01 USD. If your price can’t be represented in your country of sale’s currency, then we’ll round it to a value that can. If you submit the attribute multiple times, avoid submitting conflicting information. For example, don’t submit 2 different prices for the same region or the same service class. Submit shipping promotions through the promotions feed. For example, if you're offering free shipping for a 2-week summer sale, upload a shipping promotion in the merchant promotion feed and enter the dates that it is valid for. Using the code will give consumers free shipping when they check out on the website. Learn more about promotions Prominently state all additional charges that aren't related to shipping but relevant for the purchase during checkout. For example, list import duties, recycling fees, credit card fees, and service charges. Don’t submit this information as part of the tax or price attributes, instead bundle them with the Merchant Center shipping cost in the shipping attribute, or using the Merchant Center shipping services. Submit shipping costs for any region you ship to. If you don’t submit a shipping cost for a region that you ship to, either in your product data or through your account shipping settings, your product or account could be disapproved. Align your Shopping campaigns in Google Ads with your shipping settings and the availability of your product. Learn how to personalize ads for geographic locations Additional guidelines Review each section closely to determine if the requirements apply to your country or product. If you don't follow requirements that apply to you, we'll disapprove your product and let you know in Diagnostics in your Merchant Center account. Sweden, Norway, or Finland Submit the shipping cost for either a user’s address or for a collection point. If you submit shipping, you may submit the shipping cost to a collection point for specific carriers based on country. Make sure that users understand that you support one of these carriers on your website. Norway and Sweden: PostNord, DHL, Bring, Schenke Finland: Posti.fi, DHL, Bring, Schenke, Matkahuolto Argentina, Chile Submit the shipping cost for a user’s address, a collection point, or store pickup. France Shipping costs must be added for any book sales in France. Exclude shipping destinations Match availability on your landing page with the delivery settings in your product data. If you don’t deliver your products across the entire country of sale, only submit shipping cost for the regions that you deliver to. Shipping from outside the country of sale Prominently state on your landing page that additional customs-related fees may apply. For example, add a disclaimer during checkout so users are aware of these fees before they place the order. Don't submit import or export-related information as part of the tax or price attributes. Learn more about export requirements Software subscriptions and downloads Submit shipping cost as 0 (if shipping cost is required for your country of sale) when advertising an intangible product such as a software subscription, digital content, or downloadable software. You can submit shipping cost through the shipping [shipping] attribute or through your account shipping settings. Examples Text formatting To format the name, include ""shipping"", and then in parentheses add the names of the sub-attributes that you’re submitting separated by a colon ( : ). For example, to submit country [country], postal code [postal_code], and price [price]: Name shipping(country:postal_code:price) Format the value by submitting the value of each sub-attribute listed in the same order as in the name and separated with a colon ( : ). For example: Name shipping(country:postal_code:price) Possible value US:80302:6.49 USD Possible value US:30*:12.75 USD You can also just submit the price. For example: Name shipping(price) Possible value 6.49 USD If you don’t include sub-attributes in the name, still submit values for all 4 sub-attributes in this order: country [country], region [region], service [service], price [price]. For example: Name shipping Possible value US:CA:Express:6.49 USD If you don’t want to provide an optional sub-attribute (like service) for a particular product, then still add a colon ( : ), but leave the text blank. For example: Name shipping Possible value US:::6.49 USD Name shipping(country:region:price) Possible value US::6.49 USD Repeated fields (regional shipping example) Text You can submit up to 100 shipping values per item to indicate different costs for individual locations. To submit multiple locations, submit the attribute (with the same name) multiple times. For example: Product data for an orthopedic dog bed Attribute Value Title [title] XXL Orthopedic Dog Bed Shipping [shipping] US:94002-95460:0 USD Shipping [shipping] US:900*-901*:0 USD Shipping [shipping] US:902*-930*:15.99 USD   XML To submit multiple delivery groups for an XML feed, include an additional attribute for each delivery group. You can submit up to 100 shipping [shipping] attributes for each product. <g:shipping>    <g:country>US</g:country>    <g:region>CA</g:region>    <g:service>Express</g:service>    <g:price>0 USD</g:price> </g:shipping> <g:shipping>    <g:country>US</g:country>    <g:region>OR</g:region>    <g:service>Ground</g:service>    <g:price>4.99 USD</g:price> </g:shipping> <g:shipping>    <g:country>US</g:country>    <g:region>WA</g:region>    <g:service>Ground</g:service>    <g:price>6.49 USD</g:price> </g:shipping> Postal codes For the United States and Australia, you can submit ZIP or postal codes through the postal code [postal_code] sub-attribute. There are several different ways you can submit these values. Submit single ZIP or postcode Include the entire code. For example: 94043 Submit a range of codes Include 2 full codes separated by a hyphen ( - ). For example: 94002-95460 Submit a range of codes using a wildcard Include any number of digits followed by an asterisk ( * ). This example would include all codes starting in 94. For example: 94* Submit a range of codes using 2 prefixes with wildcards Use 2 prefixes with asterisks ( * ) and a hyphen ( - ) to create a more narrow range. Use the same number of digits for both prefixes. For example: 94*-95* Free shipping, software subscriptions, and downloads Include free shipping by submitting a value of 0 USD in the currency of your country of sale for the shipping price [shipping_price] sub-attribute. If your product is intangible, such as with a one-time download or a software subscription, you would also set the shipping to 0. For example: Product data for a one-year subscription for Google Security software priced at 29.90 USD Attribute Value Title [title] Google Security Software Basic Edition (1-year subscription) Price [price] 29.90 USD Google product category [google_product_category] Software > Computer Software > Antivirus & Security Software Brand [brand] Google Shipping [shipping] US:::0 USD Image link [image_link] http://www.example.com/image1.jpg Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit Need more help?

The English version is the official language we use to enforce our policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Display & Video 360 users must comply with this Google Ads policy. Visit the Display & Video 360 help center for additional restrictions. Welcome to the Google Advertising Policies Center Overview of our policies We want to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystem—one that is trustworthy and transparent, and works for users, advertisers, and publishers. The purpose of this help center is to help you build Google Ads campaigns that align with our advertising policies listed below. These policies are designed not only to abide by laws but to ensure a safe and positive experience for our users. This means that our policies prohibit some content that we believe to be harmful to users and the overall advertising ecosystem. We use a combination of automated and human evaluation to ensure Google Ads comply with these policies.  Our advertising policies cover four broad areas: Prohibited content: Content you can't advertise on the Google Network Prohibited practices: Things you can't do if you want to advertise with us Restricted content and features: Content you can advertise, but with limitations Editorial and technical: Quality standards for your ads, websites, and apps Click through the policies below for policy definitions, examples, and troubleshooting steps.  Prohibited content Counterfeit goods Google Ads prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner. This policy applies to the content of your ad and your website or app.  Dangerous products or services We want to help keep people safe both online and offline, so we don't allow the promotion of some products or services that cause damage, harm, or injury. Examples of dangerous content: Recreational drugs (chemical or herbal); psychoactive substances; equipment to facilitate drug use; weapons, ammunition, explosive materials and fireworks; instructions for making explosives or other harmful products; tobacco products Enabling dishonest behavior We value honesty and fairness, so we don't allow the promotion of products or services that are designed to enable dishonest behavior. Examples of products or services that enable dishonest behavior: Hacking software or instructions; services designed to artificially inflate ad or website traffic; fake documents; academic cheating services Inappropriate content We value diversity and respect for others, and we strive to avoid offending users, so we don’t allow ads or destinations that display shocking content or promote hatred, intolerance, discrimination, or violence. Examples of inappropriate or offensive content: bullying or intimidation of an individual or group, racial discrimination, hate group paraphernalia, graphic crime scene or accident images, cruelty to animals, murder, self-harm, extortion or blackmail, sale or trade of endangered species, ads using profane language Prohibited practices Abusing the ad network We want ads across the Google Network to be useful, varied, relevant, and safe for users. We don’t allow advertisers to run ads, content, or destinations that attempt to trick or circumvent our ad review processes. Examples of abuse of the ad network: promoting content that contains malware; ""cloaking"" or using other techniques to hide the true destination that users are directed to; ""arbitrage"" or promoting destinations for the sole or primary purpose of showing ads; promoting ""bridge"" or ""gateway"" destinations that are solely designed to send users elsewhere; advertising with the sole or primary intent of gaining public social network endorsements from the user; ""gaming"" or manipulating settings in an attempt to circumvent our policy review systems Data collection and use We want users to trust that information about them will be respected and handled with appropriate care. As such, our advertising partners should not misuse this information, nor collect it for unclear purposes or without appropriate disclosures or security measures. Note that additional policies apply when using personalized advertising, which includes remarketing and custom audiences. If you use personalized advertising targeting features, be sure to review the personalized ads data collection and use policies. Examples of user information that should be handled with care: full name; email address; mailing address; phone number; national identity, pension, social security, tax ID, health care, or driver's license number; birth date or mother's maiden name in addition to any of the above information; financial status; political affiliation; sexual orientation; race or ethnicity; religion Examples of irresponsible data collection & use: obtaining credit card information over a non-secure server, promotions that claim to know a user's sexual orientation or financial status, violations of our policies that apply to interest-based advertising and remarketing Misrepresentation We want users to trust the ads on our platform, so we strive to ensure ads are clear and honest, and provide the information that users need to make informed decisions. We don’t allow ads or destinations that deceive users by excluding relevant product information or providing misleading information about products, services, or businesses. Examples of misrepresentation: omitting or obscuring billing details such as how, what, and when users will be charged; omitting or obscuring charges associated with financial services such as interest rates, fees, and penalties; failing to display tax or licence numbers, contact information, or physical address where relevant; making offers that aren't actually available; making misleading or unrealistic claims regarding weight loss or financial gain; collecting donations under false pretenses; ""phishing"" or falsely purporting to be a reputable company in order to get users to part with valuable personal or financial information Restricted content and features The policies below cover content that is sometimes legally or culturally sensitive. Online advertising can be a powerful way to reach customers, but in sensitive areas, we also work hard to avoid showing these ads when and where they might be inappropriate. For that reason, we allow the promotion of the content below, but on a limited basis. These promotions may not show to every user in every location, and advertisers may need to meet additional requirements before their ads are eligible to run. Note that not all ad products, features, or networks are able to support this restricted content. Further details can be found in the Policy Center. Default Ads Treatment Google is committed to delivering a safe and trustworthy ad experience for all users. That’s why we limit serving certain types of ad categories for users that aren't signed in or users that our systems indicate are under 18. Sexual content Ads should respect user preferences and comply with legal regulations, so we don't allow certain kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations.  Some kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations are allowed only if they comply with the policies below and don't target minors, but they will only show in limited scenarios based on user search queries, user age, and local laws where the ad is being served.  Learn about what happens if you violate our policies. Examples of restricted sexual content: Visible genitalia and female breasts, hook-up dating, sex toys, strip clubs, sexually suggestive live chat, and models in sexualized poses. Alcohol We abide by local alcohol laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of alcohol-related advertising, both for alcohol and drinks that resemble alcohol. Some types of alcohol-related ads are allowed if they meet the policies below, don’t target minors, and target only countries that are explicitly allowed to show alcohol ads. Examples of restricted alcoholic beverages: beer, wine, sake, spirits or hard alcohol, Champagne, fortified wine, non-alcoholic beer, non-alcoholic wine, and non-alcoholic distilled spirits Copyrights We abide by local copyright laws and protect the rights of copyright holders, so we don’t allow ads that are unauthorized to use copyrighted content. If you are legally authorized to use copyrighted content, apply for certification to advertise. If you see unauthorized content, submit a copyright-related complaint. Gambling and games We support responsible gambling advertising and abide by local gambling laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of gambling-related advertising. Gambling-related ads are allowed if they comply with the policies below and the advertiser has received the proper Google Ads certification. Gambling ads must target approved countries, have a landing page that displays information about responsible gambling, and never target minors. Check local regulations for the areas you want to target. Examples of restricted gambling-related content: physical casinos; sites where users can bet on poker, bingo, roulette, or sports events; national or private lotteries; sports odds aggregator sites; sites offering bonus codes or promotional offers for gambling sites; online educational materials for casino-based games; sites offering ""poker-for-fun"" games; non-casino-based cash game sites Healthcare and medicines We are dedicated to following advertising regulations for healthcare and medicine, so we expect that ads and destinations follow appropriate laws and industry standards. Some healthcare-related content can’t be advertised at all, while others can only be advertised if the advertiser is certified with Google and targets only approved countries. Check local regulations for the areas you want to target. Political content We support responsible political advertising and expect all political ads and destinations to comply with local campaign and election laws for any areas they target. This policy includes legally mandated election “silence periods.”   Examples of political content: promotion of political parties or candidates, political issue advocacy Financial services We want users to have adequate information to make informed financial decisions. Our policies are designed to give users information to weigh the costs associated with financial products and services, and to protect users from harmful or deceitful practices. For the purposes of this policy, we consider financial products and services to be those related to the management or investment of money and cryptocurrencies, including personalized advice. When promoting financial products and services, you must comply with state and local regulations for any region or country that your ads target — for example, include specific disclosures required by local law. Refer to our non-exhaustive list of country-specific requirements for more information but note that advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target. Trademarks There are multiple factors that determine when trademarks can be used in ads. Along with the factors described in our Policy Center, these policies apply only when a trademark owner has submitted a valid complaint to Google. Legal requirements You’re always responsible for ensuring that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations, in addition to Google's advertising policies, for all of the locations where your ads are showing. Other restricted businesses We restrict certain kinds of businesses from advertising with us to prevent users from being exploited, even if individual businesses appear to comply with our other policies. Based on our own continuous reviews, and feedback from users, regulators, and consumer protection authorities, we occasionally identify products or services that are prone to abuse. If we feel that certain kinds of businesses pose an unreasonable risk to user safety or user experience, then we may limit or stop related ads from running. Restricted ad formats and features There are multiple factors that determine access to advanced ad formats and features on Google Ads. Certain ad formats are not available for all advertisers until they meet our specific requirements or complete the certification process. Requirements for made for kids content Advertisers may not run personalized ads on content set as made for kids. See here for categories restricted for advertising on made for kids content. Editorial & technical requirements We want to deliver ads that are engaging for users without being annoying or difficult to interact with, so we've developed editorial requirements to help keep your ads appealing to users. We've also specified technical requirements to help users and advertisers get the most out of the variety of ad formats we offer. Editorial In order to provide a quality user experience, Google requires that all ads, extensions, and destinations meet high professional and editorial standards. We only allow ads that are clear, professional in appearance, and that lead users to content that is relevant, useful, and easy to interact with. Examples of promotions that don't meet these editorial and professional requirements: overly generic ads that contain vague phrases such as ""Buy products here"" gimmicky use of words, numbers, letters, punctuation, or symbols such as FREE, f-r-e-e, and F₹€€!! Destination requirements We want consumers to have a good experience when they click on an ad, so ad destinations must offer unique value to users and be functional, useful, and easy to navigate. Examples of promotions that don't meet destination requirements: a display URL that does not accurately reflect the URL of the landing page, such as ""google.com"" taking users to ""gmail.com"" sites or apps that are under construction, parked domains, or are just not working sites that are not viewable in commonly used browsers sites that have disabled the browser's back button Technical requirements To help us keep ads clear and functional, advertisers must meet our technical requirements. Ad format requirements In order to help you provide a quality user experience and deliver attractive, professional-looking ads, we only allow ads that comply with specific requirements for each ad format. Review the requirements for all ad formats that you're using. Note that we don't allow Non-family safe ads in image ads, video ads, and other non-text ad formats. Read more about our Adult content policy. Advertisers participating in beta programs of new ad formats should reach out to their Google Ads representatives or Google Ads customer support to learn about format-specific policy requirements. Examples of ad format requirements: character limits for the ad headline or body, image size requirements, file size limits, video length limits, aspect ratios   About our policies Google Ads enables businesses of all sizes, from around the world, to promote a wide variety of products, services, applications, and websites on Google and across our network. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms, and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network. Google requires that advertisers comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, as well as any other places your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us.   Need help?

If you do decide to visit the dwelling in person, make sure to respect social distancing practices and take safety precautions, such as wearing a mask, not touching your face and washing your hands before and after the visit. Most importantly, if you feel sick, don’t visit an apartment in person — a virtual visit can be just as helpful! Clarify what would be included in the rent and what is your responsibility. Ask if major appliances are included, such as the refrigerator and stove, or if you will have to provide your own. Find out whether heat is included. If not, plan for extra winter costs. You can check with Hydro Québec for the approximate cost of your electricity bill. Ask about the unit's history with vermin, pests and damages. Leases and deposits Deposits for more than the first month’s rent are not permitted in Quebec; a landlord cannot ask you for anything more than the first month's rent. If you sign a rental application and are accepted, you are legally obligated to sign a lease. Landlords cannot ask you for your SIN (social insurance number), student visa, credit card, or photocopy any of your personal information, though they can verify your name and address with a piece of photo ID. Avoiding rental scams Rental scams can take on many forms. The goal may be to get money or personal information from apartment hunters for something that either doesn’t exist, or an apartment they have no legal right to rent. During these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, apartment hunters are more vulnerable to scams. Looking for an apartment is already stressful enough without the added time pressure and inability to visit in person. Luckily, there are many ways to lower the likelihood of getting caught in an apartment scam. Trust your gut and be critical when looking for an apartment. If something feels weird with the listing, if the application process is rushed or if the apartment seems too good to be true, it may be a scam. Red flags (things to watch for) The apartment is too good to be true: Whenever you see an apartment that seems too good to be true, it probably is. An apartment that is very cheap for the size or area is a red flag. You are asked to send money before signing a lease or visiting the apartment (virtually or physically). You are asked to pay with online coupons, money transfer, cryptocurrency or other untraceable methods of payment. The landlord is too eager or pushy: This can be suspicious. They might claim that there is a lot of interest in the apartment to pressure you into an agreement. Asking for too much information. Requiring a deposit of more than the first month of rent when signing the lease — in Quebec, any kind of deposit is illegal. Refusing to sign a lease: If a landlord wants you to pay rent or any other fee without signing a lease, it might be because they don’t have a legal right to rent out that apartment, or it doesn’t exist. The landlord is “out of the country”: A common rental scam is a ‘landlord’ who claims they’re out of the country. Scammers may even pretend to be an agent for a real estate company or a management company acting on behalf of a landlord who’s out of the country. To verify that the person behind the listing is the landlord, do your own background check on the municipal directory of property owners or do a Google search on the management company to see if they’re trustworthy. Tips to avoid rental scams Ask a friend or family member to look over the listing with you. A second pair of eyes is always helpful when looking for signs of a scam. Use the Google images reverse search function to see if the photos have been posted before. Apartment rental scams often copy listings from other real listings, but change details or lower the price to lure in apartment hunters. Do your research on the building or management company. Be sure the person you’re speaking to is the landlord or their representative, and you can find out who owns the building through the municipal directory of property owners. Always sign a lease. As a tenant, it’s your right to have an official Quebec lease drawn up in either French or English, the language of your choice. Never send money before signing a lease. When paying rent, always make sure to get a rental receipt as proof of payment. Average neighbourhood price ranges There are many different neighbourhoods in Montreal that can be considered good for a university student, depending on your priorities. Here are the price ranges you can expect for each of the main areas of Montreal: Apartment size Downtown Montreal Plateau Mont-Royal NDG / Westmount / Côte-Saint-Luc Côte-des-Neiges South-West Montreal & Verdun Studio $800 to $1,000 $700 to $900 $600 to $800 $600 to $850 $550 to $800 1 bedroom $1,100 to $1,300 $800 to $1,100 $800 to $1,000 $800 to $1,200 $700 to $1,100 2 bedroom $1,500 to $1,800 $1,100 to $1,500 $1,000 to $1,500 $1,000 to $1,400 $750 to $1,500 3 bedroom $1,600 to $2,000 $1,500 to $2,000 $1,300 to $1,800 $1,200 to $1,700 $1,000 to $1,700 Closest Métro stations Atwater Guy-Concordia Lionel-Groulx McGill Peel Place-des-Arts Saint-Laurent Sherbrooke Mont-Royal Laurier Berri-UQAM Vendôme Villa-Maria Côte-des-Neiges Plamondon Côte-Sainte-Catherine Snowdon Université-de-Montréal Namur Charlevoix De L'Église LaSalle Verdun FAQ about off-campus housing When should I start looking for off-campus housing? As soon as possible. If your budget can accommodate it and you are coming from inside Canada, you might consider looking for a lease that starts on July 1, as there are more options available at that time. International students will not be allowed entry into Canada before August 1 but if they can afford the extra month, they might consider doing the same. If that’s not possible, start looking now anyway, to gauge what’s available and try to figure out what neighbourhood is the best fit for you. Can I sign a lease remotely? Yes, you can sign a lease remotely. Be sure that the lease you are signing is a lease mandated by the Tribunal administratif de logement (TAL), which is the required lease document in Quebec. You can purchase a “Lease of a Dwelling” from Les Publications du Québec. Make sure all your responsibilities as a tenant are clear and that anything included in the agreement is written in the lease. The landlord will often add an appendix and/or list of building regulations. Make sure you read this through carefully. How do I know my apartment will be safe if I can’t visit in person? Video tours can be deceiving and sometimes you're shown a different unit than what you are signing up to rent. In the context of COVID-19, we understand that many will not be able to tour apartments in person. It is best that you do a few virtual visits, and once you're sure of an apartment, then make a single appointment to visit in person, before you sign your lease. Ask questions to clear any doubts you have. Another good rule of thumb is: if it seems too good to be true, it is. Watch out for any red flags such as the landlord asking for too much information, the apartment being too cheap for the neighbourhood, and weird demands in the contract. Know that if you are unsure, you can ask someone at the Concordia Student Union's Off-Campus Housing and Job Resource Centre (HOJO) to look it over for you to help you make the right decision. How do I find a roommate? Start with the Concordia Student Union's Off-Campus Housing and Job Resource Centre (HOJO) roommate classifieds. You can also join the 2021-2022 New Concordians Facebook page, where there will be threads about housing and other students looking for roommates throughout the spring and summer.  There are many platforms you can use to find roommates online. Take a look at classifieds.csu.qc.ca, a Concordia-only apartment and room posting page. Here you can see ads that have been posted by other Concordia students looking for roommates, or individual apartments posted by landlords looking for student tenants. There are also many Facebook groups for international students looking for roommates or housing. Though we aren't affiliated with these groups, we have heard from students that they are also a good resource. I’m finding the rentals near campus to be outside my budget. Where should I look for more affordable options? To learn more about the different neighborhoods in Montreal, you can look at our multilingual site likehome.info. This is a website we have created that offers useful information about different aspects of renting an apartment in Montreal and also has an interactive map that displays different neighborhoods with a transit map overlay. There’s a super useful feature on the upper-left side that allows you to select neighborhoods that are within a 20-minute commute to campus. When you click on a specific neighborhood, it gives you a description of the area, the average rent for different sized apartments and the different metro or bus lines that bring you to campus.  Some neighbourhoods that are farther from campus but might have some more affordable options are: Park Extension, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, LaSalle, Ville Emard, and Ahuntsic-Cartierville. You can even consider commuting from across the St. Lawrence River, via bus, metro, or train (and coming soon, light rail). Longueuil and Laval, suburbs across the river, can be reached by metro. As you expand your search away from campus, keep the public transit map in mind.  Living within a 10-minute walk of a public transit station will make your commute to campus much easier. Use a map app that includes a transit option to see the distance via transit between an apartment you’re looking at, and the Concordia campus (SGW or Loyola) where most of your in-person activities are expected to take place. See Getting to campus for an overview view of all your transportation options.   How should I narrow my search for more affordable housing? If you’re expecting to have most of your in-person activities at the Loyola Campus, start by looking at neighbourhoods in the western end of Montreal: Verdun, LaSalle, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (NDG), Montreal West. If you’ll be at the SGW Campus more, consider looking in the areas of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, St-Michel, or in the suburb of Longueuil or Brossard (which connect via metro to downtown Montreal). Use a map app to determine what the main transit (metro and bus) routes are in the neighbourhoods that you’re looking at, and try to locate housing close to those routes. What are my rights as a tenant in Quebec? Is it ever possible to negotiate a lower rent with a landlord? It’s very important to know your rights as a tenant in Quebec. Due to the high demand for affordable housing in 2021, there are increased cases of Quebec landlords failing to abide by the usual laws about rent and tenants rights. Standing up for your rights is your responsibility. Quebec has a rent control system, which is unique in Canada. What does rent control mean for tenants? Your landlord can only legally increase your rent by a certain percentage per year, as determined every year by the Quebec government. In other words, you should not be paying more than a small percentage more than the previous tenants of any apartment. On the Tribunal administratif du logement (TAL) lease (the only legally binding lease document in Quebec), be sure to check “section G,” where the landlord is required to write the lowest rent paid for their rental in the last 12 months. The rent you are being charged can only be a government-approved percentage more than the amount in section G. If a landlord has left section G blank in the lease, you can ask them to provide that information and they are required by law to do so. If the amount in Section G is much lower than what you are being charged, you have 10 days after the section is filled out to request a hearing with Quebec’s rental authority, the Tribunal administratif du logement. By requesting a hearing (which you can do online), you are starting the process of potentially lowering your rent back down to the legally approved level. When you move out, you can pass your lease on to a friend (called a lease transfer, or transfer de bail), without the rent increasing beyond a government-approved percentage, usually between 1 and 3%. You always need to ask your landlord’s permission in writing before assigning a lease transfer to a friend. Rent control is in place to defend your rights as a tenant, but it’s up to you to make sure your landlord is complying with the rules. Can I submit multiple applications to different landlords at the same time? It’s not a good idea to send out multiple applications at the same time. If you send an application for a rental, you are legally bound to sign a lease if your application is accepted. A useful trick is to make your application valid only for a certain time frame, say 48 hours. (You can make a note of this on the application, and inform the landlord when you’re communicating with them.) That way, if you don’t hear back from the landlord within a short period of time, you can keep looking. Sometimes landlords request money at the time of the application. Be aware that there’s no guarantee that an application fee will either be refunded, or will be credited toward your rent. Send a landlord money online at your own risk. How can my landlord use my personal information? Remember that within a landlord-tenant dispute, Concordia University will never get involved. A landlord cannot report a tenant to Canada customs, nor to the university, for a matter having to do with housing. They can call the police for matters to do with creating a disturbance or any criminal activity, but anything related to utilities or apartment maintenance is not a police matter. How will I get around Montreal if I’m living off campus?  You can get around Montreal by public transit, on foot, by bike, or by car. Montreal's public transit system is efficient and affordable, and Concordia’s SGW Campus is located at the Guy-Concordia metro stop. The Loyola Campus is accessible by several bus lines, in addition to the Concordia shuttle that runs between the two campuses throughout the day.  See more information about getting to campus Should I bring my car? Many people opt to use public transit or bike (even in the winter in some cases!) both because the city is relatively easy to get around without a car, and because the roads can be hectic. But if you’re looking for a place to live in Montreal, and you’re considering bringing your car, keep in mind you may have the option of buying a vignette, or a resident’s parking permit from your borough. The permit lets you park on the street in your neighbourhood.

Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.About these termsBy law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service.

But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.If these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements.
