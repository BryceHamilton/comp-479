The conference is scheduled to be in person. There is no registration fee. The conference  This two-day international conference brings together academics and professionals from various disciplines to rethink organizational responsibility during times of crisis. What does it mean for organizations to act responsibly during a crisis (e.g., in terms of processes they put into place, people they involve, changes they make or do not make)? How can organizations prepare to be able to act responsibly in future crises? How can the organizations deal with the fall-out of a crisis to ensure they act responsibly? This conference seeks to encourage and outline answers to these questions by promoting conversations about responsibility in organizations during times of crisis. The research questions We invite submissions for qualitative, quantitative, and theoretical papers that address, but are not limited to, the following questions: What is organizational responsibility during crises? What does it mean to be a responsible organization, and what actions does it involve? Does it depend on context (e.g., time, place)? What are the people, practices, and processes involved in how organizations act (ir)responsibly during crises? What enables and constrains their roles?  What are the critical questions regarding organizational responsibility during crises today? How can researchers and educators approach these questions? What have we learned about organizational responsibility from past crises? How can these lessons apply today? What theories can we use to rethink responsibility during crises (e.g., from economics, sociology, philosophy, political science)? Submission modalities  The deadline for submitting abstracts is December 31, 2021. Please submit your abstract (approximatively 500 words) using two documents, one blind (without author names) and one full (including author names), via email, using the subject line “Responsibility Conference Abstract.” To simplify the logistics, the conference team will consider the submitting author to be the corresponding author. All submissions will be peer-reviewed, and acceptances will be sent out to each corresponding author by January 15, 2022. Detailed information regarding conference registration (which is free), transportation and accommodation will then be provided as well. If your abstract is accepted, the full paper is due by March 31, 2022. Pandemic safety measures In planning the conference, the team follows the safety guidelines and requirements of Concordia University. The conference is scheduled to be held in person. However, should the pandemic context change and in-person events not be possible at the time of the conference, the conference will be held remotely.  Conference details The conference starts in the early afternoon of Thursday, April 21, 2022, at the John Molson School of Business, with an opening session that presents the conference’s aims. After that, the first conference workshop will welcome participants who have been accepted to present their work during 30-minute sessions that include a discussant. Each conference participant discusses a paper. At the end of the afternoon, all participants are invited to welcome drinks. Refreshments are served all afternoon. On Friday, April 22, 2022, the conference workshops will proceed throughout the day. All conference participants are invited to the conference luncheon, and refreshments are served throughout the day. The conference concludes in the afternoon with a discussion that presents critical lessons. There is no registration fee for the conference.

Use the EMERGENCY BREAK for serious emergencies only It is located in the middle of the car near the doors. If possible, pull the emergency brake when the car is stopped at a station and the doors are open. The operator can then intervene more quickly and easily. If the emergency brake is pulled while the train is moving, the train will generally stop in the station or at the next one. The train operator will go to the car where the brake was pulled to assess the situation. . Travel support teams In some of the busier métro stations, travel support teams are deployed during morning and evening rush hours. The teams, made up of STM employees and Montréal police officers, are there to help in the event of an incident and to ensure customers understand and obey the rules. Adopt safe habits KEEP YOUR DISTANCES For your safety, stand behind the yellow line.

Future students Student hub Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search News Sports leagues can fight climate change with lockdown-era schedules, Concordia research shows As 2020-21 proved, reduced and optimized team travel can have a major impact on greenhouse-gas emissions November 16, 2021 | By 		Patrick Lejtenyi Photo by John McArthur on Unsplash The past two North American pro-sports seasons have been exceptional in many ways: fewer games played, more regional travel and more same-city “baseball-style” series with consecutive matchups between the same home and visiting teams. It was an unusual experience for everyone involved, but a good one for the environment, writes Concordia researcher Seth Wynes. In a new paper just published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, Wynes, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment, writes that the drop in travel among the four major sports leagues in North America — Major League Baseball, National Football League, National Basketball Association and National Hockey League — had a noticeable effect on their carbon footprints. His analysis estimates that in 2018 the four leagues combined for about 7.5 million kilometres of air travel on 5,655 flights, generating nearly 122,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. However, if travel patterns enacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic were permanently adopted, emissions from team travel would drop by 22 per cent, more than 25,000 tonnes. While that is a small fraction of total global annual emissions, cutting down air travel could also send an important message to the public, given sports franchises’ high visibility and deep fan base. “Athletes are role models,” Wynes says. “If they can show that they are serious about fighting climate change, fans will see it, and it might inspire other business communities to step up the plate, so to speak, and get things done.” All trips taken during the 2018 season by league.

For instance, in 2020 the NHL used “baseball-style” series, when a team arrives at a city and plays multiple games in a row there, rather than immediately leaving and returning later in the season. Major League Baseball has been doing this for years and it explains why their emissions per game are substantially lower than other leagues. Teams can also play more games against opponents in nearby cities, rather than making frequent flights across the continent. These minor changes can add up quickly. To determine the saved emissions, Wynes based his calculations on a per-regular-season-game basis. Emissions from air travel in 2018 per league. Credit: Seth Wynes Data from the International Civil Aviation Organization was used for variables such as how flight distance varies based on traffic and weather, as well as fuel-burn rates. When no data on the type of aircraft used was available, Wynes assumed teams flew on Boeing 737s, which have a relatively low emissions intensity. Because each kilogram of fuel burned results in 3.16 kilograms of CO2, Wynes was able to roughly calculate the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per team flight based on estimated fuel usage. The same formula applied to both pre-COVID sports seasons and to pandemic-shortened, geographically re-sorted seasons revealed significant reductions in total emissions per game and trip. Seth Wynes: “If athletes can show that they are serious about fighting climate change, fans will see it, and it might inspire other business communities to step up the plate.” Good for players, leagues and the environment Enacting all these changes, including shortening seasons to reduce the overall number of trips, remains a challenge. “Status quo bias represents a real obstacle — a lot of companies have an attitude that if it isn’t broken, why fix it?” says Wynes. “And, depending on the league, these changes might require agreement from the owners and the players’ union. Those are competing stakeholders with different interests. Plus the short-term incentives to instituting these changes during COVID are no longer there.” Emphasizing co-benefits to reduced travel, including a shorter schedule, might help convince stakeholders that the changes could be worthwhile, Wynes argues. “More rest between games would cut down on injuries,” he notes. “A couple of major injuries to star players could hurt ratings in the playoffs, and that might spur a league to address the rest issue.” The leagues could be more resistant to pressure to act on climate change but, he adds, “Perhaps a powerful social movement could spur them to act so that they can prove to their fans that they are dealing with this crisis.” Read the cited paper: COVID-19 disruption demonstrates win-win climate solutions for major league sports: Related topics 	 Research subjects 	 	 Press Release 	 	 climate change 	 You might also like: Concordia’s leading climate change researchers make their voices heard at COP26 Concordia researchers develop a new model to assess for flood hazards Trending Concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the Montreal Climate Partnership November 10, 2021 Improvements to Concordia’s Henry F.

This page explains when you may apply for a supplemental exam and how to do it. Be sure to review all the university regulations concerning supplemental examinations in the undergraduate calendar. Read regulations concerning supplemental examinations What a supplemental examination means A supplemental examination gives students who have failed a course a second chance to re-write the final exam without re-registering for the course. A supplemental examination does not replace your final exam and does not change your final grade in the course. If you write a supplemental exam: The original grade for the course (F/FDNW) will remain permanently on your student transcript. A second entry for the course appears on your transcript, with your supplemental exam grade also counted towards your new grade. Both grades (the original F/FDNW and the passing grade) count towards your cumulative and final graduation GPA. If you fail the supplemental exam, both failure grades will be counted in the calculation of the cumulative and final graduation GPA. Consider repeating the course If you repeat the course, both grades (the original F/FDNW and the second grade) will appear on your transcript – but only the second (most recent) grade will be counted towards your GPA. Read more about repeating courses in section 16.2.6 of the Undergraduate Calendar. Eligibility for supplemental exams You may apply for a supplemental examination if you meet the following requirements: You must be in good academic standing; your last annual grade point average must be at least 2.00. You must have a grade of F or F/DNW in the course. You have not yet written a supplemental exam for the same course. You may not apply for a supplemental examination if you: Are on Probation or Conditional Standing Receive a grade of A, B, C, D, FNS, R, or NR in the course Each Faculty or School decides which courses will offer a supplemental exam and not all faculties offer them. The John Molson School of Business does not offer supplemental exams. Students in the Gina Cody School of Engineering must first submit a student request (via their department) and receive permission prior to applying for a supplement exam. How to apply for a supplemental exam You may apply for a Supplemental examination online using the following link: Apply now for a supplemental exam If you are unable to apply online, you may also download and print the Request for a supplemental examination form. This form can also be picked up at the Birks Student Service Centre (LB-185). Submit your application by the deadline. Please note that if you submit your request online, the processing fee of $40 will be charged to your student account. Students in the Gina Cody School of Engineering must submit their approved student request together with the supplement application at the Birks Student Service Center. Term Deadline Fall/Winter June 15 Summer September 16 Fall (graduating students only) February 1 Be aware that you may only write one supplemental examination for a course, whether or not you repeat it.

That means that they should not upload videos that they didn't make, or use content in their videos that someone else owns the copyright to, such as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programmes or videos made by other users, without necessary authorisations. What is fair use? Fair use is a US law that allows the reuse of copyright-protected material under certain circumstances without getting permission from the copyright owner. However, fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis, and different countries have different rules about when it's acceptable to use material without the copyright owner's permission. In the US, works of commentary, criticism, research, teaching or news reporting might be considered fair use, but it can depend on the situation. We created the YouTube Audio Library to help creators reuse content safely by providing free high-quality music and sound effects. Resources Learn more about fair use How can rightsholders make copyright claims? Everyone has access to YouTube's Copyright Management Tools, which give rightsholders control of their copyrighted material on YouTube. We work with rightsholders to match them to appropriate features based on the scale of their copyrighted content on YouTube and the resources that they've dedicated to responsibly managing their content online. Our Copyright Management Suite provides a number of ways for rightsholders to make copyright claims. Webform The simplest way to have unauthorised copies of copyrighted content removed is by manually submitting a copyright notification through our DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) webform. This tool is best for most users – it is open to everyone and available in every language. Copyright Match Tool The Copyright Match Tool uses the power of Content ID matching technology to find re-uploads of videos on YouTube. Available to over 1,500,000 channels, it identifies near-full re-uploads of a creator's original videos on other YouTube channels and allows the creator to choose an action to take: they can request the removal of the video, message the uploader of the video or simply archive the match if they do not want to take any action. Any user with a demonstrated history of successful DMCA takedowns via our webform can apply for access using our public form. Content ID Content ID is our solution for those with the most complex rights management needs. It is our digital fingerprinting system that allows rightsholders to upload content that they have exclusive rights to as reference files, and then scans videos uploaded to YouTube for matches of that content. When a user uploads content, Content ID scans against the database for matching videos. If there is a match, then an action is taken based on the predefined rules or policies that a content owner sets themselves: Block a whole video from being viewed. Creators do not receive a copyright strike if the content owner blocks a video. Monetise the video by running ads against it, in some cases sharing revenue with the uploader. Track the video's viewership statistics. In most cases, this means that rightsholders don't need to submit copyright takedowns for these videos and instead have the opportunity to monetise and run ads in exchange for the videos being live. Resources Learn more about YouTube's copyright management tools Learn more about copyright strikes What action does YouTube take for copyright infringement? If a copyright owner submits a valid DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) complaint through our webform, we take down that video and apply a copyright strike. If a user gets three copyright strikes in 90 days, their account, along with any associated channels, will be terminated. We also have tools to help creators resolve their copyright strikes – including waiting for it to expire after 90 days, requesting a retraction or submitting a counter notification. Content ID works differently. If a match between a reference file and a new upload is found, a 'claim' is made. Based on the preference selected by the Content ID owner, we'll apply a policy to track, monetise or block, but will not issue a copyright strike.

It organizes bilingual, public conversations in cafés and community spaces across Montreal. The University of the Streets Café on Hold Due to the COVID-19 pandemic that caused mandatory lockdowns and the closure of all social ventures for many months, we were unable to run the program. And while we are thankful to have maintained many connections remotely, we decided not to move the experience to the virtual world. The University of the Streets was, and is, about much more than sharing information: it connects people and helps foster communities. Although we won’t be convening these conversations at the moment, our work as the Office of Community Engagement continues. If you would like to learn more about our work or share ideas, please contact us. About Our participatory events seek to reinvent the idea of the ‘university’ by creating spaces for lifelong learning, critical thinking and community engagement in local neighbourhoods. Methodology   A public conversation is much like a conversation you’d have with friends or family around a dinner table, except with more people, more points of view, and slightly more structure. Get involved Thanks to the support of our volunteers, venues and parterning organizations, the program is free and open to participants of all ages, backgrounds and levels of education. FAQs What language are the events in? Do I need to register? What is the cost, and answers to other important questions.   Winter-Spring 2020: Our Communities This season of University of the Streets Café looks at questions of belongingness in our cities and neighborhoods. Who gets to experience a sense of belonging in relation to the spaces we live in? Who doesn't and why? To what extent is this sense of connection affected by factors outside of sphere of influence? How can we in turn reclaim our capacity to hold a relationship with our communities? We encourage you to draw your own links between these conversations or to experience them individually. See coverage from our fall 2020 season, The Right to Stay Put: How can we resist being forced out of our neighborhoods? Source, CBC Montreal November 27, 2019. For more information Accessibility We strive to hold all of our public conversations in venues that are accessible to persons with limited mobility. Contact us to find out more about the accessibility details or for any accessibility-related questions and/or needs.

Prevention and customer support are central to their work. Every day, they defuse a range of small events that could have an impact on bus and métro service. The Security and Control team includes: 164 inspectors and special constables 1 superintendent 4 captains head of sections 7 operations lieutenants 10 sergeants (operations supervisors) 2 lieutenants-instructors certified by the École nationale de police du Québec 4 prevention officers Since it’s important to us that the various Montréal communities be represented, 35% of the Security and Control team is made up of people from diverse backgrounds. In fact, the members of the team speak 20 different languages. Ouvrir la section: Comments and complaints Would you like to make a comment or complaint about a situation involving a special constable? Contact us through the online form or by phone. Close From inspectors to special constables Inspectors are gradually being trained to become special constables, a fairly prominent role in public transit in all large Canadian cities, but still relatively unknown in Quebec. This status is key to allowing our inspectors to fully support our customers and employees. The first special constables were sworn in during summer 2021, and other cohorts will complete their training in the coming year. The following are a few myths about the role of inspectors and special constables that need to be debunked. Ouvrir la section: MYTH no. 1: Inspectors are always at the same stations; they’re never around when you need them. False It’s true that, at peak periods, they can often be found in the busiest parts of the network, in particular to ensure smooth customer flow. However, they’re always ready to move quickly in the event of problems elsewhere in the network, by métro or by car. And, with a 71-km métro network and 227 bus lines covering an area of 500 km2, monitoring the entire network 24/7 is no easy feat! During the day and in the evenings, 60% of inspectors and special constables on duty are assigned to the Centre-West region (which includes the downtown area) and 40% are assigned to the East region. The teams cover the bus and métro networks in each of these two service regions. Overnight, since the métro is closed and fewer bus lines are in operation, the team on duty covers the entire territory. There is also some overlap between work shifts to ensure a constant presence across the entire network, day, evening and night. If you need help and you can’t find an inspector, approach any STM employee or pick up a telephone at one of the emergency assistance stations on the platforms. Everyone will swing into action to make sure you get the help you need. Close Ouvrir la section: MYTH no. 2: STM inspectors and special constables are not police officers. True They undergo a 14-week training period at the École nationale de police du Québec (ÉNPQ) in Nicolet and are professionals who specialize in public transit safety. Although the occupation is not very well known in Quebec, it is no less a source of pride and, most importantly, is not in competition with the occupation of police officer. On the contrary, a complementary approach is adopted to ensure everyone’s safety. The inspectors and special constables work closely with police services, more specifically the métro unit of the SPVM, the SPL (Laval) and the SPAL (Longueuil) Special constables undergo more specific training that covers, among other things, legal aspects, criminal offences in a context of public transit, criminal law powers and duties, unconscious bias (profiling) and police ethics. Inspectors are then sworn in before a Court of Québec judge, and then become special constables. To learn more about training for STM inspectors (French only)  Close Ouvrir la section: MYTH no. 3: Anyone can become an inspector or special constable at the STM. False The hiring and training process prior to obtaining inspector or special constable status is consistent with the role that they will be required to assume: enriching, but very demanding. We receive an average of 500 applications a year for the job of STM inspector. Of this number, 300 applicants meet the basic requirements (e.g., work experience, education) and are invited to attend an information session. If the applicants are still interested, they undergo a judgement test: that’s the first elimination round! Then, they undergo a physical exam and go through simulations. At this stage, only 50% of applicants successfully move on to the next step: the behavioural interview. A few verification procedures complete the process, and the best candidates are offered a contract, provided they successfully complete the ÉNPQ training. Only one or two cohorts graduate every year, according to the STM’s needs and the ÉNPQ’s capacity. The entire hiring process is very rigorous: if there is even the slightest doubt, an application can be set aside. Close Ouvrir la section: MYTH no. 4: Inspectors and special constables are there strictly to control fares and issue tickets. False Obviously, inspectors and special constables are responsible for ensuring that all customers pay their transit fare, but that’s far from their only role. Much of their work involves carrying out preventive interventions that help avert numerous incidents and service disruptions. In 2020, they responded to 31,628 calls for service and issued 5,704 tickets based on fares and regulations regarding conduct. They must also: Ensure smooth customer flow during peak periods Support all customers by working with partners and organizations Support employees on the ground, who, at any time, can report a situation to an inspector, who will manage the event Play a leading role during service disruptions to control access to the stations and platforms, support customers in the event of an incident and ensure customer flow Monitor facilities and ensure that active worksites, tail tracks, mechanical rooms, terminals, parking lots, bus garages and stations, among others, are secured. In addition, to ensure that each small everyday event is transparent during your trips, they work with a number of internal (e.g., control room, station employees, drivers) and external (e.g., Urgences-santé, SPVM) partners. Inspectors and special constables will tell you that they never get bored in the network. Close Ouvrir la section: MYTH no. 5: The aim of the special constable status is to have more power over customers. False This new status means that the roles and responsibilities of inspectors are changing to better ensure everyone’s safety. The primary mandate of the Security and Control team remains the same: to support customers on a daily basis. Special constables can, however, take action in situations where it was impossible to do so before, which improves the response time for customers in need. A few examples of situations in which constables can intervene:  If a customer or an employee is the victim of an assault or a crime, a special constable can arrest the attacker and hand him or her over to the police, based on reasonable grounds. If an individual is in crisis and is a risk to his or her own or another person’s safety, a constable can take action. If parked vehicles are obstructing a drop-off area or reserved lanes, constables can issue tickets or have vehicles towed. In addition, transparency and legal responsibility are increased, since constables are subject to the Police Act and, consequently, Quebec’s Police Ethics Commissioner. The Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI) is also able to take over investigations in accordance with the Act. This enhances the rigorous processes already in place internally, in addition to STM employees’ code of conduct. Close Ouvrir la section: MYTH no. 6: New special constables will carry firearms. False Special constables will be allowed to carry the same equipment as inspectors, namely an extendable baton, which can be used for defensive purposes. In all interventions, the key for our inspectors and special constables is first and foremost to come to a peaceful resolution by focusing on communication in order to defuse any problem situation. Close Ouvrir la section: MYTH no. 7: Inspectors always issue tickets to homeless people. False Obviously, we have by-laws, and one of the roles of inspectors is to ensure compliance with these by-laws for the sake of everyone’s safety. However, inspectors and special constables must demonstrate good judgment when dealing with all types of clientele, and homeless people are certainly no exception. The aim of the winter plan, in partnership with the Société de développement social (SDS), is to ensure that social workers provide inspectors with greater support. The goal: do prevention, provide assistance and leave no one out in the cold. During major cold spells, we work with different organizations to help those in need and ensure peace of mind for everyone. Among the measures put in place, the STM offers the old Brewery Mission a bus to provide safe transportation for homeless people to emergency shelters. Lastly, a new mixed patrol was launched in 2020. Called Équipe métro d’intervention et de concertation (ÉMIC), this specialized patrol made up of a police officer, an STM inspector and an SDS social worker direct homeless people toward the right resources. It also provides service to support Security and Control inspectors and SPVM police officers in resolving issues in the métro. Close Ouvrir la section: MYTH no. 8: I’m not required to identify myself when asked to do so by an inspector or special constable. True When an inspector or special constable has reason to believe that you have committed an offence, and you are informed of the alleged offence, you have to identify yourself. Refusing to identify yourself may, under certain circumstances, constitute an obstruction to the inspector’s or special constable’s work, and he or she could detain you until you identify yourself, and issue a ticket for obstruction, in accordance with the laws in effect. Are inspectors required to identify themselves? Yes. In addition to having their name inscribed on their vest, inspectors have to identify themselves (name and employee number) at a customer’s request. This information is also specified on the ticket, if applicable. Close City of Montréal police officers Police officers from the City of Montréal police department (SPVM) are assigned to work directly in métro stations and surrounding neighbourhoods to ensure the safety of passengers and business owners. They are also responsible for reducing the frequency of worrisome and disruptive incidents to ensure the peace of mind of all Montrealers. Mixed patrols Specialized patrols made up of a police officer, an STM inspector and an SDS social worker will direct homeless people toward the appropriate resources.

These policies apply to all types of content on our platform, including videos, comments, links and thumbnails. Our Community Guidelines are a key part of our broader suite of policies and are regularly evaluated in consultation with outside experts and YouTube creators to keep pace with emerging challenges. We enforce these Community Guidelines using a combination of human reviewers and machine learning, and apply them to everyone equally – regardless of the subject or the creator's background, political viewpoint, position or affiliation. Our policies aim to make YouTube a safer community while still giving creators the freedom to share a broad range of experiences and perspectives. What areas do Community Guidelines cover? You'll find a full list of our Community Guidelines below: Spam and deceptive practices Fake engagement Impersonation External links Spam, deceptive practices and scams Playlists Additional policies Sensitive content Child safety Thumbnails Nudity and sexual content Suicide and self-injury Vulgar language Violent or dangerous content Harassment and cyberbullying Harmful or dangerous content Hate speech Violent criminal organisations Violent or graphic content Regulated goods Firearms Sale of illegal or regulated goods or services Misinformation Misinformation Elections misinformation COVID-19 medical misinformation In addition to Community Guidelines, creators who want to monetise content on YouTube must comply with Monetization Policies. How does YouTube develop new policies and update existing ones? Each of our policies is carefully thought through so that they are consistent, well-informed and can be applied to content from around the world. They're developed in consultation with a wide range of external industry and policy experts, as well as YouTube Creators. New policies go through multiple rounds of testing before they go live to ensure that our global team of content reviewers can apply them accurately and consistently. This work is never finished, and we are always evaluating our policies to understand how we can better strike a balance between keeping the YouTube community protected and giving everyone a voice. How does YouTube enforce its Community Guidelines? 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. That's a lot of content, which is why our teams come together to make sure that what you see on our platform follows our Community Guidelines. To do that, we combine the power of advanced machine learning systems and our community itself to flag potentially problematic content. Our machine learning systems and expert reviewers then remove flagged content that violates our Community Guidelines. How does YouTube identify content that violates the Community Guidelines? With hundreds of hours of new content uploaded to YouTube every minute, we use a combination of people and machine learning to detect problematic content at scale. Machine learning is well suited to detect patterns, which helps us to find content that is similar to other content that we've already removed, even before it's viewed. We also recognise that the best way to quickly remove content is to anticipate problems before they emerge. Our Intelligence Desk monitors the news, social media and user reports to detect new trends surrounding inappropriate content, and works to make sure that our teams are prepared to address them before they can become a larger issue. Is there a way for the broader community to flag harmful content? The YouTube community also plays an important role in flagging content they think is inappropriate. If you see content that you think violates the Community Guidelines, you can use our flagging feature to submit content for review. We developed the YouTube Trusted Flagger programme to provide robust content reporting processes to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with expertise in a policy area, government agencies and individuals with high flagging accuracy rates. Participants receive training on YouTube policies and have a direct path of communication with our Trust and Safety specialists. Videos flagged by Trusted Flaggers are not automatically removed. They are subject to the same human review as videos flagged by any other user, but we may expedite review by our teams. NGOs also receive occasional online training on YouTube policies. How does YouTube treat educational, documentary, scientific or artistic content? Sometimes videos that might otherwise violate our Community Guidelines may be allowed to stay on YouTube if the content offers a compelling reason with visible context for viewers. We often refer to this exception as 'EDSA', which stands for 'educational, documentary, scientific or artistic'. To help determine whether a video might qualify for an EDSA exception, we look at multiple factors, including the video title, descriptions and the context provided. EDSA exceptions are a critical way in which we make sure that important speech stays on YouTube, while protecting the wider YouTube ecosystem from harmful content. Resources Read more about how we treat EDSA content on YouTube What action does YouTube take for content that violates the Community Guidelines? Machine-learning systems help us identify and remove spam automatically, as well as remove re-uploads of content that we've already reviewed and determined violates our policies. YouTube takes action on other flagged videos after review by trained human reviewers. They assess whether the content does indeed violate our policies, and protect content that has an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purpose. Our reviewer teams remove content that violates our policies and age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for all audiences. Reviewers' inputs are then used to train and improve the accuracy of our systems on a much larger scale. Community Guidelines strikes If our reviewers decide that content violates our Community Guidelines, we remove the content and send a notice to the creator. The first time that a creator violates our Community Guidelines, they receive a warning with no penalty to the channel. After one warning, we'll issue a Community Guidelines strike to the channel and the account will have temporary restrictions including not being allowed to upload videos, live streams or stories for a one-week period. Channels that receive three strikes within a 90-day period will be terminated. Channels that are dedicated to violating our policies or that have a single case of severe abuse of the platform will bypass our strikes system and be terminated. All strikes and terminations can be appealed if the creator believes that there was an error, and our teams will re-review the decision. Resources Learn more about Community Guidelines strikes Appeal a Community Guidelines strike Age-restricting content Sometimes content doesn't violate our Community Guidelines but may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 years of age. In these cases, our review team will place an age restriction on the video so that it will not be visible to viewers under 18 years of age, logged-out users or to those who have Restricted mode enabled.

When studying for a doctoral degree (PhD), candidates submit a thesis that provides a critical review of the current state of knowledge of the thesis subject as well as the student’s own contributions to the subject. The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract The motivation to engineer biological systems through standardization and abstraction sparked the development of technological advances in automation of life-sciences since the early 2000's. Now, robotics are performing high-throughput tasks with increasingly higher precision and control over the environment of precious biological samples. At the same time, a different set of hardware has emerged in the life-sciences. While robotics enable for high-throughput automation, microfluidics - the discipline of handling fluids on a micro scale - allows researchers and clinicians to perform experiments they could not have imagined before. These highly controlled devices can purify proteins, engineer cells, gain insights to single-cell ‘omic’ information, or filter out a patient’s cancer cells in a fully automated fashion. In this work, we are focused on designing novel microfluidic devices for single-cell analysis. Currently, the use of single-cell analysis microfluidic devices open up the possibility of gaining detailed insights in heterozygosity of cell populations when coupled with next-generation sequencing technologies. We propose the design of a microfluidic setup that has improved control over single-cell operations within droplet-in-channel microfluidic architectures compared to current systems. Expanding these 'droplet-digital' tools, we have developed a microfluidic system for binary sorting of droplet libraries, on-demand droplet generation, droplet mixing, droplet storage and release, and deterministic encapsulation of single-cells . We propose new methods to sort cells, such as filamentous fungi libraries based on enzyme production, yeast based on growth rate and mammalian cell single-clones based on gene-editing efficiency. This work involves the development of novel hardware and software, and the integration of our microfluidic device within an automation system to operate droplet-digital microfluidics. Such systems are expanding the toolbox of those who are ‘engineering biology’.

This year, the day comes with the call to #PressforProgress, with the understanding that historical achievements such as women’s rights to public education or casting an electoral vote don’t yet extend globally while all too often equal pay for equal work remains a goal. Concordia experts are available to provide a progress report from various points of view.   A pink budget? The Trudeau government has repeatedly stated equality for women is one of its top priorities. Because it’s 2018, does the recent budget announced by Finance Minister Bill Morneau reflect that priority? Geneviève Rail, a researcher in the Simone de Beauvoir Institute, can analyze the budget with an eye to its impact on women. Geneviève Rail, Professor, Simone de Beauvoir Institute Gen.rail@concordia.ca 514 848-2424, ext. 5856   Maker Spaces: making room for women in tech  Could Maker Spaces become a point of entry for greater numbers of girls and women to pursue studies in traditionally male-dominated and increasingly digitized industries? Ann-Louise Davidson would answer with an emphatic YES! As a professor of educational technology and Concordia Research Chair in Maker Culture, Davidson has witnessed first-hand how high-tech workshops that invite school girls to pick up tools and learn coding can turn them onto math and science. But she’s also encountered harassment and resistance from men in this innovative field. Ann-Louise Davidson,  Associate Professor, Department of Education  ann-louise.davidson@concordia.ca 514 848-2424, ext. 5476   Feminists’ strange partnership with the evangelical right Carly Daniel-Hughes’ research focuses on the history of Christianity, women, gender and sexuality in Religion. She recently wrote about the curious association of feminists and right-wing evangelicals in the United States in the battle against the global sex trade and how that association is shaping public attitudes about sex work. Carly Daniel Hughes,  Associate Professor and Chair, Department of Religions and Cultures  carly.danielhughes@concordia.ca 514 848-2424, ext. 2066   Do we still need International Women’s Day? Homa Hoodfar’s research on the condition of women around the world may well have led to her imprisonment in her native Iran, on March 9, 2016. Freed four months later, Hoodfar believes marking the day is more important than ever as young women risk losing sight of the battles the previous generations fought for their rights and their freedom.

The application of composite curved tubes for landing gear of helicopters instead of aluminum is the subject of interest for the aerospace industry. The focus of the present work is to study mechanical behavior of composite straight and curved composite tubes subjected to the bending loading which is similar to the loading conditions of cross tubes for landing gear of helicopters during landing. The analysis of these structures with a large number of layers may be computationally expensive. The finite element method is widely used for stress analysis of initially curved composite tubes. This method is computationally expensive for design and optimization process. The main objective of the present thesis is to develop an efficient, simple-input method for stress analysis of initially curved and straight composite tubes under four-point bending loadings. To do so, different methodologies for stress analysis of straight and initially curve tubes are introduced. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods are presented. The first part of this thesis focuses on the stress analysis of straight composite cylinders under pure bending moment. The 3D elasticity of Lekhnitskii is employed to carry out the stress analysis of an anisotropic cylinders with many layers. In the second part, an analytical meshless polynomial based method in conjunction with dimensional reduction method are presented to carry out cross-sectional analysis as well as determining strain distribution in straight and curved composite tubes under bending loading (four-point bending loading) in which the effect of shear strains is taken into consideration. In order to obtain the stiffness constants of the cross-section and strains, the powerful mathematical Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) is employed to decompose a three-dimensional elasticity problem into a two-dimensional cross-sectional analysis and a one-dimensional analysis along the length. The VAM presents Classical and Timoshenko beam models and cross-sectional stiffness matrices. In the Classical beam model cross-sectional stiffness matrix, the effect of shear is not considered. In order to achieve a more precise beam model for the analysis of initially curved and straight tubular beams, the Timoshenko-like beam model and the effect of shear strain is taken into consideration. The presented polynomial meshless dimensional reduction method is employed for tubes with circular and elliptical cross-sections. Based on the VAM, a commercial finite element based cross-sectional analysis software named Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional Analysis (VABS) is released. In the present work, the utilization of the Pascal polynomials for the cross-sectional analysis of the b beams takes advantage of the meshless method compared with the three-dimensional finite element method or VABS. Moreover, a one-dimensional finite element solution is provided for straight and initially curved composite tubes. The presented method for the analysis of initially curved and straight tubes is computationally more efficient and simple-input compared to the 3D finite element method. In addition, it eliminates generating two-dimensional cross-sectional mesh and dividing the cross-section into different segments for straight and curved tubes compared to Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional Analysis (VABS) software. So, the present method can be more efficient and straightforward in terms of modeling procedure compared to VABS. The parametric study such as determining cross-sectional stiffness constants, strains and displacements for design and optimization will be more straightforward. The experimental tests are carried out to validate the present method of solution. Test setups for four-point bending test of the straight and initially curved tubes are provided by a teamwork at Concordia Center for Composites (CONCOM). The obtained strains at different spots of the tubes as well as the transverse displacement are compared with the theoretical solution. The effect of lay-up sequence, initial curvature on the mechanical behavior of the composite tubes are studied.

Permanent Code Surcharge Effective Summer 2021 term (2211) $ 581.31 per credit The Quebec government requires that all students who are registered at a Québec University have a “permanent code”, a unique identifying number which is assigned by the government. All students who have attended a Québec elementary school, high school, CEGEP or University have been assigned a permanent code. The permanent code appears on all official Québec school certificates and CEGEP transcripts. Students who do not provide a valid permanent code with their application must apply for one. Students who do not submit or apply for a permanent code will be charged an additional premium. Information on how to apply for a permanent code and a link to the online “Permanent Code Data” form can be found on the Enrolment Services, Permanent Code website. The online form must be completed and submitted to the Birks Student Service Centre in S-LB-185 along with all supporting documents. 4. Compulsory fees Frais institutionnels obligatoires (FIO) charged by the University and (generated by a registration)  Compulsory fees ensure that you receive the necessary services and support you need to succeed throughout your academic journey. They range from administrative support to the various student services offered to technological services. The fees you pay depend on if you are an undergraduate or graduate student and the nature of your studies.

See how. Home Products YouTube Terms YouTube API Services - Subject API Services Note: The new Complying with the YouTube Developer Policies guide provides guidance and examples to help you ensure that your API clients adhere to specific portions of the YouTube API Services Terms and Policies (API TOS). This guidance offers insight into how YouTube enforces certain aspects of the API TOS but does not replace any existing documents. The YouTube API Services Terms of Service (the ""Terms"") state (in Section 14) that when YouTube intends to make backward-incompatible changes to YouTube API services, YouTube will announce those changes and try to continue to maintain the software code for six months after the announcement. This page identifies the Subject API Services referenced in section 14.3 (Special Terms) of the Terms and explains how that section of the Terms affects actual deprecation dates. Prior to February 10, 2017, which is the effective date of the current Terms, the Subject API Services had been subject to a one-year deprecation policy under the previous set of Terms. To honor that policy, the Subject API Services are, temporarily, subject to different deprecation rules than other services. Understanding deprecation dates In the event of backward-incompatible changes to Subject API Services, YouTube will use reasonable efforts to maintain code until at least February 10, 2018, which is one year after these Terms became effective. For other services, YouTube will try to continue to maintain the software code for six months from the date those changes are announced. Exemptions Some features of Subject API Services are not subject to the rules defined in Section 14.3 of the Terms because those features were also not subject to the deprecation policy defined under the prior set of Terms. Those features are identified as exemptions in the list of subject services below. When an exemption applies to an object property, it also applies to any of that property's child properties. In addition, the exemption applies to the ability to retrieve, set, modify, or delete values of the property or its child properties as well as to the property values themselves.

As chief financial officer Denis Cossette announced at the closing event on November 16, the Concordia Centraide Campaign 2021 raised $217,997 and counting. That figure surpassed the goal of $200,000 as well as last year’s total at this point of the campaign. Donors can contribute to the 2021 campaign until December 31. Concordia President Graham Carr reminded the event’s remote attendees that the approaching winter will put an added strain on the social services Centraide of Greater Montreal provides vulnerable members of the Montreal community — who will be hit even harder this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Carr gave special thanks to co-chairs Nadia Bhuiyan and Philippe Beauregard as well as Cosette, Suzanne Kaye, project coordinator in the Office of the President, Loredana Carbone, manager of research events and engagement in the Office of the Vice-President Research and Graduate Studies, and the others who contributed in many ways. “As someone who has the privilege to serve on the board of Centraide itself, I want to thank everyone for their volunteerism, their support and their donations, which makes a tangible difference in the lives of tens of thousands of our fellow citizens here in the Greater Montreal area,” he said. Bhuiyan, vice-provost of partnerships and experiential learning, also thanked the 25 members of the campaign committee, the leaders campaign co-chairs, and the internal partners and sectors: CUPFA CUFA, ACUMAE, University Advancement, University Communications Services and Human Resources. “Like last year, we were all proud to see how the Concordia community came up with great online fundraising events, trivia night, silent auction and pet photo contest, and many other events,” she said. She also expressed her gratitude to the Centraide team that supported Concordia, including Côme Bardi. Bardi explained that Centraide supports some 350 local community agencies and projects and helps out about one in five Montrealers, more than 800,000 people in total each year. The organization’s investments include the development of a much-used telephone helpline and support for the 211 phone line, which helps individuals find social and community resources. “Remember: every dollar counts,” Bardi said. Cossette, a Leaders Campaign co-chair, reported this year 399 donors so far have given to the campaign, including 64 leaders — those who donate $1,200 or more. Since the Hewitt Foundation matches leadership gifts, the total impact of Concordia’s gift is about $225,000-plus. “I’ve been associated with Centraide for many years, and each year I continue to be very proud of the contribution and support you give,” he said of the Concordia community. This year, all donors of $20 or more were automatically registered for the raffle draws. Referring to an online wheel that included all the eligible names, Philippe Beauregard, chief communications officer, announced the seven prize winners. Florence Figols, a part-time instructor of contemporary dance in the Faculty of Fine Arts, won the top prize, an Apple watch, worth about $470. Beauregard added that a Now news story in early 2022 will report the final amount raised by the Concordia Centraide Campaign. Donors can continue to give to Concordia Centraide Campaign 2021 until December 31. Look in your inbox for an email from centraide@unclic.com sent on or after October 12 or send an email to centraide@concordia.ca to learn how to give using payroll deduction or a one-time gift.   Related topics 	 generosity 	 	 Centraide 	 	 community 	 You might also like: Why Centraide?

STM escalators   Taking the escalator is an every day action, a commonplace occurrence. As a result, we sometimes forget how certain seemingly benign behaviours can actually cause harm. Recommended behaviour Hold the handrail If you lose your balance or if the escalator suddenly stops, holding the handrail may prevent you from falling. Mind the stairs Overly long clothing, untied shoe laces or accessories dragging on the floor are all likely to get tangled in the top or bottom platforms or wedged in the gap on either side of the stairs. When clothing gets caught in the stairs’ mechanism, the movements of other people are impacted and can result in injury. Avoid carrying bulky items Escalators are designed to carry people, not objects. Oversize luggage could obstruct your view, cause you to lose your balance or prevent you from properly holding the handrail. Ask for help with your stroller A stroller’s wheels can get caught between the stairs and the bristles on each side, particularly at the top and bottom of the stairs. When such an incident happens, the escalator’s landing platform is blocked off, and people standing behind could fall on top of the stroller. It would be preferable to remove children from the stroller, hold them by the hand while holding the handrail with the other. The folded stroller could then be carried by another person using the escalator.  Stand up  You may feel it is safer to sit children down on the stairs, but that is not the case. Something as simple as sitting down can increase the risk of their clothes touching the stairs and getting snagged. Also, when children sit down on the stairs, their little hands and fingers are close to the stairs’ moving parts, causing more frequent and serious accidents. Face the same direction taken by escalator Travelling backwards on an escalator increases your risk of tripping on the top or bottom landing and falling. Do not run Running up or down an escalator increases the risk level both for you and for other people using it. You could fall or cause someone to lose their balance. Be particularly careful when you enter the building when it is raining or snowing, because the stairs can be more slippery when they are wet. What to do in the event of an emergency? If you witness such an incident, first stop the escalator by pushing the emergency stop buttons located at the top and bottom of the stairs. There are two types of escalators in the métro network and each one has a different emergency button. Most widespread model:   Where is the bouton? to the right of the handrail, at waist level. How to use it? Press the top of the protective case to open it and then push the red button. Texte important The other type: Where is the bouton? To the right of the handrail, at floor level. How to use it? Simply push the red button. Warning! Pressing an escalator's emergency stop buttons for no good reason is subject to a $200 fine. If someone is injured, call 911 or ask an employee for help. STM escalators Impressive equipment The STM’s underground system has 296 escalators and with 250 million passenger rides taken annually in the métro, they undergo heavy use. Furthermore, several escalators are quite close to entrance doors, subjecting them to bad weather outside and temperature changes. Up and running When the time comes to replace an escalator, the STM imposes particularly stringent requirements on suppliers, exceeding B44 building code standards that regulate elevators, freight elevators and escalators. This guarantees that the escalators we install are safe, durable and able to withstand the intensive use they get in our operating environment. Each escalator is a complex system, and its precision assembly is crucial. Some 1500 drawings are produced to design new equipment. In addition, each escalator features more than forty safety switches and other hidden sensors over its entire length. We do our own maintenance! Once an escalator is put into service, its maintenance is handled by employees working for the métro’s stationary equipment group. This presents many advantages, as escalators can then be put back into service much faster after an incident. It also means we maintain our expertise in that area. Interventions following an incident Minor incidents related to improper use are the main reason for shutting down escalators. For example, dropped items, items getting caught or people falling all require that the escalator be stopped. Improper use of the equipment itself, such as riding the handrail or pushing the emergency stop button for no reason, can also put an escalator out of service. If a minor incident causes no damage to the escalator, it can be put back into operation quickly by a station employee. However, if an incident results in a potential risk to the equipment’s integrity, the escalator will automatically shut down until a special team of mechanics can inspect it, carry out any necessary adjustments, and start it up again. So where are the maintenance crews? Maybe you saw an out-of-service escalator in your station and you wondered about it, because if it is not working, it impacts on your daily commute. But that’s normal: the steps that need to be followed to carry out repairs, like removing old or defective stairs, are done at night. During the day, our crews often work on mechanical parts under the stairs, unseen by the public. That’s why many people think no one is working on them.

If you fail a supplemental examination you will receive a grade of “R” in the course. If you do not write a supplemental examination, your student record remains unchanged. If you do not write the supplemental exam when scheduled, you forfeit the chance to write the supplemental and you must repeat the course if it is a requirement for your degree. However, a missed supplemental exam will not appear on your transcript. If you were unable to write your supplemental exam If extraordinary circumstances prevented you from writing the supplemental examination, you may apply to the University Examinations Committee. Please refer to the Request for “DEF” notation section for further information.

You can use the ""Subscriber bell notifications"" and “Bell notifications sent” card in YouTube Studio to learn about the impact of notifications. These cards will automatically appear when you have enough reachable subscribers. Learn more about notification options on YouTube.  View subscriber bell notification metrics Sign in to YouTube Studio. In the left menu, select Analytics. Select Audience. Find the “Subscriber bell notifications” card. Learn about subscriber bell notification metrics The “Subscriber bell notifications” card gives you an idea of what percent of your subscribers get notifications from your channel including: new video uploads, premieres, and live streams.  Subscribers who turned on “All notifications” for your channel: The “Subscribers who turned on “All notifications” for your channel” metric represents the percent of your subscribers that have chosen to get all notifications. Subscribers who turned on “All notifications” for your channel and enabled YouTube notifications: The Subscribers who turned on “All notifications” for your channel and enabled YouTube notifications metric tells you what percent of subscribers have turned on all notifications for your channel. These subscribers also have notifications enabled for their Google Account and device. If subscribers ring the bell, but turn off YouTube notifications for their account or mobile app, they won't count toward this metric. Subscribers that “enabled YouTube notifications” are signed in and can receive notifications on at least one device. These subscribers have turned on account notifications either: On a computer under Settings  Notifications  Channel subscriptions OR On mobile under Settings  Notifications  Subscriptions and have also enabled YouTube notifications on at least one device: For computers, turn on Settings  Notifications  Computer notifications For mobile devices, make sure YouTube app notifications are enabled within your device’s settings View bell notifications sent metrics The “Bell notifications sent” card automatically shows on the Reach tab of YouTube Analytics when you have enough subscribers. The card is available for individual videos. Sign in to YouTube Studio. From the left menu, select Content. Click the video’s title or thumbnail. In the left menu, select Analytics  Reach. Find the “Bell notifications sent” card. Learn about bell notifications sent metrics Bell notifications sent: The number of bell notifications sent to subscribers who get all notifications from your channel, and have turned on YouTube notifications for their account and device. Notifications CTR (click-through rate): The percentage of viewers who clicked the bell notification they got about your video. Views from bell notifications: Views you got from viewers who clicked a bell notification and immediately watched your video. This number does not include viewers who saw your bell notification and watched your video later. You can get a breakdown of views from app notifications versus email updates in your Reach report. Watch to learn about subscriber notifications Check out the following video from the YouTube Creators channel to learn more about subscriber notifications. Were Notifications Sent to My Subscribers? Subscriber bell notification FAQs What does ”turned on “All notifications” for your channel” mean? There are a few different versions of the bell to help viewers understand the different types of YouTube notifications:  All: Subscribers will get all notifications from your channel, except notifications that exceed daily limits. Personalized: Subscribers will get a customized subset of notifications from your channel. None: Subscribers will see this version of the bell if they can’t get notifications from your channel due to their device settings. The “Subscribers who turned on “All notifications for your channel” metric does not include subscribers who choose to get personalized notification or those who turned off notifications from your channel in their Subscriptions manager or Channel settings. Learn more about settings that impact notifications. How do I get my viewers to subscribe to all notifications from my channel? Some viewers will not want to get all notifications from every channel they subscribe to. For some, all notifications can be overwhelming, and can lead to a viewer turning off notifications altogether. Encourage your subscribers to choose the notification level that’s right for them. If you have viewers who want to get all notifications, but are having trouble getting them, send them the notifications troubleshooter. I’m below the “Typical on YouTube” range. Is that bad? Subscribers who turned on “All notifications” for your channel Many channels don’t fall in this range and still perform well. Notifications are one of many traffic sources for views (for example: Up next, Home, or search). Different channels will see varying percentages of traffic from different traffic sources.  There are many factors that influence whether a subscriber wants all channel notifications all the time. Subscriber notification choice may be influenced by factors like upload frequency, video topics, or other channel subscriptions. Subscribers who turned on “All notifications” for your channel and enabled YouTube notifications If you are within the typical range for subscribers who turned on all notifications for your channel, but below the range for notifications enabled, consider asking viewers to use the notifications troubleshooter. These viewers showed interest in getting all notifications by ringing the bell. They may not know that they’re unable to get notifications. Can I see my subscriber notification metrics for previous time periods? The Subscriber bell notifications card only shows current metrics. Historical values are not available.  If I get new subscribers, will my subscriber metrics increase immediately? Subscriber metrics are updated daily, but have a 2-day delay. If you post a video on Monday and get new subscribers, they’ll be reflected in your metrics on Wednesday. Bell notifications sent FAQ How should I use the “Bell notifications sent” card? The “Bell notifications sent” works together with the “Subscriber bell notifications” card: The “Subscriber bell notifications” card shows what portion of your subscribers clicked the bell  to get all notifications from your entire channel. It also shows how many of those subscribers are eligible to get notifications, based on their device and account settings. The “Bell notifications sent” card shows how many viewers got your bell notification, clicked it, and watched your video. This card also shows the number of subscribers you had when publishing your video who were eligible to get a bell notification. How are my notifications CTR different from my thumbnail CTR? Your notifications CTR represents how many viewers saw a bell notification for your video and clicked it. Your thumbnail CTR represents how many viewers saw your video thumbnail on YouTube and clicked it. Learn more about your impressions and CTR. Why is my notifications CTR lower than my impressions CTR? It’s typical for your notifications CTR to be lower than your impressions CTR.  People get notifications throughout their day, but can’t  watch videos. They may be at work or cooking dinner. Your impressions CTR is measured based on activity on YouTube. It represents behavior from viewers who are actively looking for something to watch on YouTube, rather than viewers in the midst of their day-to-day life.  Why didn’t all my notifications send? Here are the most common reasons your “Bell notification sent” may be less than 100%: Your channel already sent the maximum of 3 video notifications in a 24-hour period. You published more than 3 videos in a short amount of time. Your subscriber count changed significantly in the last 24 hours. Learn more. You changed your video’s privacy settings before all notifications were sent. You skipped notifications for this video. How do changes in my subscriber count affect my percentage of bell notifications sent? It's typical for your subscriber count to change often. If for some reason your subscriber count significantly changes just before you publish a video, you may see less than 100% bell notifications sent. In these situations, we'll still notify all eligible subscribers, but the card may show less than 100% due to reporting delays. I’m below the “Typical on YouTube” range for notifications CTR. Is that bad? There are many factors that influence whether a subscriber will click to open a notification. Viewers may not click a notification depending on time of day, what they’re doing, and so on.  Many channels don’t fall in this range and still perform well. Notifications are just one of many traffic sources for views. Other sources include Up next, Home, search, external sources, and the Subscriptions feed. Different channels get varying percentages of traffic from different traffic sources. Can I check the “Bell notifications sent” card for previous time periods? Historical values aren’t available for the “Bell notifications sent” card. If you change the date range in YouTube Analytics, the data in the card will stay the same.

If tax info isn’t provided, Google may be required to withhold at the maximum rate. Google is required to collect tax info from creators in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). If any tax deductions apply, Google will withhold taxes on YouTube earnings from viewers in the U.S. from ad views, YouTube Premium, Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Channel Memberships. Why Google withholds U.S. taxes Google has a responsibility under Chapter 3 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to collect tax info, withhold taxes, and report to the Internal Revenue Service (the U.S. tax authority, also known as the IRS) when a YPP creator on YouTube earns royalty revenue from viewers in the U.S. If you have earnings from viewers in the U.S., Google may begin deducting taxes (known as withholding) as early as June 2021. Note: YouTube and Google can’t provide advice on tax issues. Consult a tax professional to better understand your tax situation. Submitting tax info to Google  All monetizing creators on YouTube, regardless of their location in the world, are required to provide tax info. Please submit your tax info as soon as possible. If your tax info isn’t provided by May 31, 2021, Google may be required to deduct up to 24% of your total earnings worldwide.  You can follow the instructions below to submit your U.S. tax info to Google. Note that you may be asked to re-submit tax info every three years, and that only Latin characters may be used when submitting tax forms (due to requirements by the IRS); learn more here Sign in to your AdSense account. Click Payments. Click Manage settings. Scroll to ""Payments profile"" and click edit next to ""United States tax info"". Click Manage tax info. On this page you'll find a guide that will help you to select the appropriate form for your tax situation. Tip: After you submit your tax information, follow the instructions above to check the “United States tax info” section of your Payments profile to find the tax withholding rates that may apply to your payments. You’ll also be able to make any edits in case your individual or business circumstances change. If you've changed your address, make sure your updated permanent address is the same in both sections: ""Permanent residence address"" and ""Legal address"". This will ensure that your year-end tax forms (e.g., 1099-MISC, 1099-K, 1042-S) are delivered to the correct location. If you’re in the US, you must resubmit your W-9 form with your updated legal address To help prepare you to submit your tax info in AdSense, go to Submitting your U.S. tax info to Google. For MCN-specific guidance, go to Tax requirements for MCNs and affiliate channels Where U.S. tax requirements apply Every YPP creator, regardless of their location in the world, is required to provide U.S. tax info to Google. Under U.S. tax law, Google is required to deduct taxes from your YouTube earnings from U.S. viewers, if applicable. The tax withholding requirements can differ depending on your country of residence, whether you're eligible to claim tax treaty benefits, and whether you identify as an Individual or a Business.  Creators outside of the U.S:  If you submit U.S. tax info, withholding rates are between 0-30% on earnings you generate from viewers in the U.S. and depend on whether your country has a tax treaty relationship with the United States.  U.S. creators: Google will not withhold taxes on earnings if you have provided valid tax info. Most U.S. creators already have submitted their U.S. tax info. Important: If no U.S. tax info is provided, Google may be required to withhold using the maximum tax rate. Your tax rate will depend on your AdSense account type and country:  Business account type: the default withholding rate will be 30% of U.S. earnings if the payee is outside of the U.S. Businesses in the U.S. will be subject to 24% withholding on total earnings worldwide.  Individual account type: backup withholding will apply and 24% of total earnings worldwide will be withheld. These withholding rates will be adjusted in the next payment cycle once valid U.S. tax info is provided in AdSense. You can follow these instructions to determine which account type your AdSense account is. Important: Google will never send unsolicited messages asking for your password or other personal information. Before clicking a link, always check the email is sent from a @youtube.com or @google.com email address. FAQ What is tax withholding? Simply put, tax withholding is when taxes are deducted from your payments so that they can be paid to a government to satisfy the payee’s U.S. tax liability.  Under U.S. tax law, Google is a withholding agent required to comply with U.S. tax law, and where required, to withhold taxes on relevant YouTube earnings. Tax withholding may begin as early as June 2021. How will this affect my income on YouTube? Only the portion of your earnings from viewers in the United States will be subject to tax withholding and reporting if you provide valid tax information.  The exact rate of tax withholding will be determined by the tax info you provide to Google. You can view your tax withholding rate in the Manage tax info section in your AdSense Payment Settings once you submit your form. Tax withholding amounts are not visible in YouTube Analytics. Hypothetical example Here’s a hypothetical example: a YouTube creator in India in the YouTube Partner Program earns $1,000 USD from YouTube in the last month. Of the $1,000 USD, their channel generated $100 USD from U.S. viewers. Here are some possible withholding scenarios: Creator doesn’t submit tax info: the final tax deduction is $240 USD because the withholding tax rate is up to 24% of total earnings worldwide if they didn't submit tax info. This means that until the creator submits complete tax info, we’ll need to deduct up to 24% of their total earnings worldwide, not just their U.S. earnings.  Creator submits tax info and claims a treaty benefit: the final tax deduction is $15 USD. This is because India and the U.S. have a tax treaty relationship that reduces the tax rate to 15% of earnings from viewers in the U.S.  Creator submits tax info, but is not eligible for a tax treaty benefit: the final tax deduction will be $30 USD. This is because the tax rate without a tax treaty is 30% of earnings from viewers in the U.S. Calculate your estimated tax withholding See how your YouTube income may be affected with the following example calculation:  Access the Revenue Report in YouTube Analytics and set the date filter to the relevant payment period (e.g. Oct 1 - 31). It may be helpful to set your YouTube Analytics to the currency you are paid in (e.g. USD).  Apply a geography filter to see estimated revenue from the United States. Learn more about your Audience in YouTube Analytics. Go to your AdSense account to find your tax withholding rate. Your withholding rate is visible after submitting your U.S. tax info. Multiply the results of steps 2 and 3 above. Note that following the above only produces an estimate of tax withholding. Once Google begins withholding taxes, you will see the finalized amount withheld in your regular AdSense Payments Transactions Report (if any apply). What if I don’t earn revenue from viewers in the U.S. on my channel? All YPP creators should submit tax info to Google regardless of if they earn revenue from viewers in the U.S. or not. In case you earn revenue from viewers in the U.S. in the future, submitting your U.S. tax info will help determine the correct withholding rate for you. What criteria are you using to determine if I am a U.S.-based creator or not? Your location is determined by the country of residence you declare in your tax info. Does this mean I will be taxed both in my country of residence as well as in the U.S.? Google is only required to withhold U.S. taxes from your YouTube earnings from viewers in the U.S. Your local income tax laws may still apply to your YouTube earnings.  Many countries have tax treaties that reduce or eliminate double taxation. In addition, certain countries may allow for foreign tax credits to help reduce international tax burdens. By claiming a tax treaty in the tax tool in AdSense, you may be able to reduce your tax burden. Please consult your tax advisor. Learn more here What kind of tax reporting documents does Google provide? You will see finalized tax withholding amounts in your AdSense Payments Report according to your payment cycle. All creators that submit tax info and who receive eligible payments, will receive a tax form (e.g. 1042-S, 1099-MISC) on or before March 15 of each year for the previous year’s tax withholdings. Visit the AdSense Help Center to request a copy, revision, or to void a year-end U.S. tax form. Can I get a tax refund from previous withholdings? Google may refund U.S. withholding tax in certain circumstances if updated tax info is provided by December 31, 2021. For example, if an updated W-8 tax form with a claim for a lower tax rate is provided in a timely fashion, Google will recalculate withholding amounts and refund the difference.  Note that you will need to provide an affidavit of unchanged circumstances and declare that the changes made to your form apply to a previous date in time. You can do this under the “Status change affidavit” section in Step 6 of the tax tool in AdSense.  These refunds will be visible in the payment cycle after you update your form.  These circumstances are limited and valid tax info must be received by the end of the calendar year in which the tax was withheld. If you don’t provide that valid tax info by the end of the calendar year, you will have to file a request for a refund directly with the IRS. We recommend you seek professional tax advice to this end. Any applicable refunds will be visible in your AdSense Payments Report at the end of the payment cycle after updating your tax info in AdSense. Affiliates in multi-channel networks (MCN) Unfortunately, Google is unable to provide refunds to affiliate channels in MCNs. Affiliates subject to U.S. withholding tax should receive either Form 1042-S or Form 1099 by April 14 of the following year. If eligible, this form may be used to seek a refund from the IRS (the U.S. tax authority). We recommend you seek professional tax advice to this end. Does this apply to my other AdSense earnings aside from YouTube? If you provide valid tax info, the U.S. withholding taxes under Chapter 3 should only apply to your YouTube earnings.

You can also find this link in My CU Account. When you drop a course online, you must make sure to confirm your transaction and/or verify your registration record to ensure that the course was in fact properly dropped. It is the student’s responsibility to meet all deadlines and follow all necessary steps to withdraw from a course(s) or from the University. Not attending classes or informing an instructor of an intent to withdraw does not constitute official withdrawal. It is not mandatory for an instructor to provide the student with any evaluation or feedback of their progress in a course before the withdrawal deadline. Students who do not properly withdraw before the published deadlines will receive failing grades. Course withdrawal There are two different types of course withdrawal: DNE (Did Not Enter) The DNE withdrawal has no academic or financial impact on the student and does not appear on the student’s academic record. DISC (Discontinued) The course as well as a DISC withdrawal notation remains on a student's academic record but does not affect the student's GPA. However, the student is financially responsible for the payment of all tuition and other fees pertaining to the course. These course withdrawal deadline dates can be found at Term Dates and Deadlines. Late Course Withdrawals How to submit a request for late withdrawal (DNE) or refund of fees on a discontinued (DISC) undergraduate course Carefully read the instructions and information on all applicable forms. Complete and sign the appropriate Student Request Form, as follows: Faculty of Arts and Science, Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science, Faculty of Fine Arts, and John Molson School of Business students: Student Request for Late Registration/Withdrawal Independent Students: Independent Student Request Form   Attach the following supporting documents to your request: A clear and detailed written explanation of the unforeseen event(s) or circumstance(s) which prevented you from dropping the course(s) by the deadline. Indicate if you are asking for a refund (financial credit) of fees for this course(s). A written statement from the instructor of the course(s) confirming when you stopped attending class and that you did not complete course work or exams after that date. All relevant documentation which supports your case. This might include (but is not limited to) such documents as: Student Request Medical Certificate (English / Français) duly completed, signed and stamped by a licensed medical practitioner (the MD’s licence number must be clearly noted on the form) hospital record(s) death certificate accident/police report travel tickets   Submit your request as follows: Students registered in a Faculty of Arts and Science program must submit to the academic department housing the program in which they are registered. Students registered in a Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science program must submit to the School's Student Academic Services Office. Students registered in a Faculty of Fine Arts program must submit to the Faculty Undergraduate Student Academic Services Office. Students registered in a John Molson School of Business program must submit to the Faculty Undergraduate Programs Office. Independent students must submit to the Birks Student Service Centre. General Rules The Student’s Responsibility Once you register in a course(s) at the University, you become responsible for: following the University’s published rules, regulations, and guidelines; and, ensuring that you understand the academic requirements of your program(s) of study. You are responsible for providing all the necessary information and supporting documentation when submitting a request. Incomplete requests will not be considered. Why are refunds normally not applicable after the DNE deadline? There are three main reasons why the University has a deadline for tuition refunds: When you withdraw after the DNE deadline, you have prevented another student from taking your seat in the classroom. If you had dropped the course before the deadline, another student could have registered for the course. The University’s costs are not reduced when you withdraw from a course, e.g. instructor’s salary, technology infrastructure, classroom space, etc. You are not the only one paying for your education. In fact, most students’ tuition fees cover only about 25% of the total cost of their education. The other 75% of your education is funded by the Ministère de l'Éducation et de l'Enseignement supérieur. When you withdraw after the DNE deadline and are granted a Late Withdrawal (retroactive DNE), the University not only forfeits the money it returns to you, but also the government funding attached to your registration. Remember, the DNE and DISC deadlines are published at Term Dates and Deadlines. Check the deadlines every term – it is your responsibility to know what the deadlines are. Exceptional circumstances In certain very limited circumstances, a student may be granted a late withdrawal (DNE) or a full/partial refund on a discontinued (DISC) course after the DNE deadline. Late withdrawals and refunds are only given when you could not have withdrawn before the DNE deadline because of serious extenuating circumstances. These circumstances must be unforeseeable and beyond your control. Please note that, if your request is approved, the University Retroactive Withdrawal Committee will decide whether you qualify for a retroactive DNE or a full/partial refund with a DISC notation. In some cases when DNE’s are granted, an administrative fee of 35$ per credit may be applied. Examples of requests that are NOT granted You did not know the deadline and/or procedures for withdrawing from courses. (Remember, you are responsible for making yourself aware of University deadlines.) Your financial situation has changed and you cannot afford to attend University any more. You lost your job, you accepted a new job offer, you have a work schedule conflict, or your work hours have increased. You have a problem with child-care arrangements. You did not attend the course(s) you registered for. You attended another university or college and did not withdraw from your Concordia course(s). You did not pay your Concordia fees by the deadline date and assumed that your current registrations would automatically be cancelled. Your government financial aid was delayed or the value of your government financial aid was less than you expected to receive. In the case of personal bankruptcy, please contact the Student Accounts Office at 514-848-2424, ext. 4900. Examples of requests that may be granted Particular medical circumstances: A serious illness or severe injury prevented you from withdrawing from your course(s) by the DNE deadline. You became seriously ill or were severely injured after the DNE deadline and, as a result were unable to complete your course(s). Requests based on medical circumstances must be accompanied by a duly completed Student Request Medical Certificate (English / Français). If this Medical Certificate is not included with your request, your request will automatically be denied. Please note that medical certificates may be verified before a request is considered and/or granted. To save time, please ensure that the medical certificate completed by your doctor includes all the information requested along with their medical license number and a telephone number where they can be reached during regular business hours. The medical certificate may be refused if it is insufficiently explicit or appears to lack seriousness or, on its face, raises doubt as to its authenticity. Unfortunately, the fact that illness is usually not predictable and is nobody’s fault, does not automatically qualify you for a late withdrawal (DNE) or a refund of fees on a discontinued (DISC) course(s). You may be able to work out an alternative way to complete a course with your professor. You may be eligible for a MED, DEF or INC course notation. See §16 of the Undergraduate Calendar for an explanation of these notations. If you must withdraw after the DNE deadline and before the DISC deadline, you have to drop the course on your student portal (My CU Account). Particular non-medical circumstances: Certain requests for late withdrawal (DNE) or a refund of fees on a discontinued (DISC) course(s) may be accepted in particular non-medical circumstances. For example: There has been a recent death in your immediate family or other circumstances which have caused you severe emotional stress. You have unexpectedly assumed long-term primary responsibility for taking care of an immediate member of your family who is seriously ill. Requests based on non-medical circumstances must be accompanied by complete supporting documents that are appropriate to the situation including, but not limited to, a death certificate, medical certificate, airline ticket, etc. Things to Remember Reason for submitting a request Your reason for the request must be related to circumstances that were unforeseeable and beyond your control. Submission deadlines A student request shall be made within a reasonable period of time from the circumstances giving rise to the request. Normally, the following guidelines apply: A request with respect to a: Must be submitted by: Summer-session course (session ending in 1) November 1 Fall-term course (term ending in 2) March 1 Fall/Winter course (term ending in 3) August 1 Winter-term course (term ending in 4) August 1 In determining whether the period of time elapsed is reasonable, all of the circumstances of the case shall be evaluated. Requests from previous academic terms will not be accepted without a detailed explanation for the delay in submitting a request. For further information, please see the Undergraduate Calendar Section 16.1.7 Student Request Committees and Refund of fees (financial credit on account or refund) Withdrawal from the university Students who wish to withdraw from the University completely must: Withdraw from their courses by the appropriate deadline ONLINE. This link can also be found in My CU Account.

What is a Content ID claim?If you upload a video that contains copyright-protected content, your video could get a Content ID claim. These claims are automatically generated when an uploaded video matches another video (or part of another video) in our Content ID system. Copyright owners can set Content ID to block uploads that match a copyrighted work they own the rights to. They can also allow the claimed content to remain on YouTube with ads. In these cases, the advertising revenue goes to the copyright owners of the claimed content. How do I know if my video has a Content ID claim? When a Content ID claims your video, you’ll get an email from YouTube. To find more details about the claims on your videos: Sign in to YouTube Studio. From the left menu, click Content. In the Restrictions column, if a video has a claim on it, it will be labeled Copyright claim. Hover over Copyright claim in the Restrictions column and click SEE DETAILS. Click the Down arrow  to expand the claim details. Under the Content found during section, click the timestamp to play the segment claimed by Content ID. You can also filter to get a list of videos that have claims on them by clicking Filter   Copyright claims. Am I in trouble if my video has a Content ID claim? Probably not. Content ID claims usually mean we found content on your YouTube channel that someone else owns. Copyright owners are the ones who decide whether other people can reuse their copyrighted content. They often allow their content to be used in YouTube videos in exchange for having ads run on those videos. Ads might play before the video or during it (if the video is longer than 8 minutes). If copyright owners don't want their content reused, they can: Block a video: Copyright owners may choose to block your video, which means people can't watch it. Your video could be blocked worldwide or just in certain countries/regions. Restrict certain platforms: Copyright owners may choose to restrict the apps or websites where their content appears. These restrictions won’t change the availability of your video on YouTube. What can I do if my video has a Content ID claim? Depending on the situation, you have a few options to choose from if you get a Content ID claim: If you agree with a claim: Do nothing: If you believe a claim is valid, you can leave it as is. You can also change your mind later. Remove the claimed content: If you believe a claim is valid, you can remove the claimed content without having to upload a new video. If done successfully, any of the 3 options below will automatically release the associated claim: Trim out a segment: This option removes just the claimed segment from your video. Learn more. Replace the song (audio claims only): If the music in your video is claimed, you may be able to replace your audio track with free-to-use music from the YouTube Audio Library. Learn more. Mute a song (audio claims only): If the music in your video is claimed, you may be able to mute the claimed song. You can choose whether to mute just the song or all audio in the video. Learn more. Share revenue: If you’re in the YouTube Partner Program and your video's music is claimed, you may be able to share revenue with the music publisher. Learn more. If you disagree with a claim: Dispute the claim: If you believe a claim made on your video is invalid, you can dispute it. Learn how to dispute a Content ID claim. If you dispute a claim without a valid reason, the content owner may request a takedown of your video. If we get a valid takedown request for your video, your account will get a copyright strike.

Future students Student hub Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search News Louise Champoux-Paillé awarded Medal of the National Assembly of Quebec John Molson executive-in-residence and Lorenzetti Centre co-director recognized for her tireless commitment to supporting women in leadership roles October 15, 2021 | By 		Katie Malazdrewicz Louise Champoux-Paillé: “It's important to ensure that no woman is held back in achieving her dreams by barriers related to her gender."" Louise Champoux-Paillé, John Molson School of Business executive-in-residence and co-director (practice) for the faculty’s recently inaugurated Barry F. Lorenzetti Centre for Women Entrepreneurship and Leadership, has been awarded the Medal of the National Assembly of Quebec. In recognition of her 50-year career and over 40 years dedicated to promoting the representation of women in decision-making bodies of various organizations, Champoux-Paillé received the prestigious honour during a ceremony held by Quebec’s National Assembly today. The National Assembly awards the medal to people of their choice who are deserving of recognition, or as an official gift to Members of other parliaments, elected officials or other public figures during missions outside Québec or protocol receptions at the Parliament Building. Louise Champoux-Paillé with Isabelle Melançon, deputy of Verdun, who presented her the award. ""Louise is a ‘grande dame’ of governance and leadership for women,"" says Anne-Marie Croteau, dean of Concordia University’s John Molson School of Business. ""She was into the subject long before it was a reality. She is a pioneer who has inspired, encouraged and mentored many women in Quebec to pursue their professional ambitions. It is a privilege to have received her first as an executive-in-residence at the John Molson School of Management and now as co-director of the Lorenzetti Center for Women Entrepreneurship and Leadership.” Many of the women of Champoux-Paillé’s generation were the first to occupy leadership positions, directors or board chairs. “For me,” Champoux-Paillé says, “what was important in this commitment to women and what continues to be so, is to ensure that no woman is held back in achieving her dreams by barriers related to her gender, and that our society is based on principles of equity.” In 2012, the Québec government named Champoux-Paillé as a member of the Ordre national du Québec. In 2014, she won the Governor General’s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case, granted to women who have made outstanding contributions to the quality of life for women in Canada. In 2016, she was appointed as a Member of the Order of Canada for her contributions as an administrator and for her commitment to promoting women in governance. She also recently received an award of excellence from Université Laval and was named one of the Top 20 personalities for diversity. Learn more about the Barry F.

Site search Concordia Directories Search School of Graduate Studies COTUTELLEGive your PhD a global perspective Did you know you can pursue doctoral research at more than one university? A cotutelle opens doors to international researchers and gives you a joint PhD.   A cotutelle refers to an agreement on joint supervision between two universities at the doctoral level. It allows the students to get a joint PhD degree delivered and recognized by both institutions. Full-time doctoral students can take advantage of an exceptional opportunity to earn a joint PhD degree while developing strong connections with international partners. Through the cotutelle program, PhD candidates work in collaboration with distinguished faculty members from Concordia and an international partner university to produce an original thesis. The program requires that students satisfy each institution's minimum requirements and submit their dissertation to both universities prior to graduation. Successful candidates receive a PhD degree from Concordia and the partner institution. Benefits of a cotutelle For the student Opportunities for international research Collaborations with other researchers A recognized joint degree from Concordia and the partner university  For the university Expansion of international relationships for Concordia Raises Concordia’s visibility abroad as a centre of cutting-edge research Provides supervisors and faculty members with opportunities to develop international collaborations Candidate FAQs Where can I do a cotutelle? You are eligible to register at any international accredited university that is open to a cotutelle agreement. Concordia supervisors must approve the partner university and agree to work in collaboration with the chosen co-supervisor. How can I apply as a Concordia student? Discuss the cotutelle plan with your current Concordia supervisor Contact Irene Grigoropoulos, graduate admission advisor at the School of Graduate Studies, to discuss a potential cotutelle before communicating with the partner university If approved, reach out to your potential co-supervisor at the partner university Follow the requirements needed to enrol at the partner university Complete a Cotutelle Agreement form with your supervisor, in collaboration with Irene Grigoropoulos All other required signatures will be collected by the School of Graduate Studies Once both universities approve the cotutelle program, you will be admitted Do I have to submit an admission application to the partner university? Yes, you must follow the partner university’s application/admission procedures. Do I have to pay tuition fees? You will pay tuition for the terms you are registered at Concordia University (a minimum of 3 non-consecutive terms are required). You need to contact the partner university for questions about their tuition fees. Do I have to start the cotutelle in the first term of my PhD? No. However, the cotutelle arrangement should be established as early as possible. Am I still eligible to receive funding if I hold a Federal or Provincial Granting Agency award? Yes, in most cases. It is best to contact the Graduate Awards Office to ensure that your particular award is eligible. Do I still receive my Concordia University internal scholarship when registered at the partner institution? Internal funding administered through the School of Graduate Studies will be honored when abroad. Students must seek approval for any internal awards administered through their department or Faculty while away on a cotutelle. Ready to begin?

Creating meaningful change on campus requires a culture of openness and closely listening to diverse community voices. We recognize that our check-ins and consultations empower us to re-think, re-imagine and re-emerge as an even better university. To continue moving forward in the right direction, we recently undertook a series of university consultations, policy reviews and improvements to the university’s digital and physical spaces to create more inclusive teaching, learning, research and work environments for people with disabilities. Highlights of some of the work recently completed and currently underway can be found below. Completion of the accessibility policy review I am pleased to share that the Accessibility Policy Advisory Group recently completed work on an updated university-wide accessibility policy. The group’s mandate included consulting with the community to review and make recommendations to update the Policy on Accessibility for Students with Disabilities (PRVPA-14) with the goal of outlining procedures, resources and options available to all university members with disabilities (students, faculty and staff) in the same policy. The newly revised policy, which will be published shortly, includes important new updates and procedures that address and expand accessibility and accommodations for students, faculty and staff. The revised policy also underlines the importance of considering the impact of intersectionality for people with disabilities. The policy is under the purview of the Office of the Provost and with the support of the Equity Office, Concordia will continue to support and advance accessibility university wide. This includes rolling out a series of best practice workshops and working directly with individual departments and units to support positive change. Making teaching and learning more accessible With a specific focus on the educational experience, this summer, Sandra Gabriele, vice-provost of Innovation in Teaching & Learning and chair of the Teaching and Learning Accessibility Advisory Committee (TLAAC), invited Concordia students and faculty to participate in surveys on their university experiences with accessibility. The committee includes students and faculty with disabilities working alongside the Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL) and the Access Centre for Students with Disabilities. With its mandate to further improve accessibility in teaching and learning, the committee will share its recommendations with the Concordia community later this fall. Rollout of a pilot project on accessible teaching This past summer, the CTL invited students and faculty to take part in a pilot project to help make their Moodle pages more accessible. Following training they received as accessibility change agents, students worked with faculty to develop a variety of best practices in accessible teaching. These practices include performing accessibility audits of Moodle courses and of commonly used teaching tools such as Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), Microsoft PowerPoint and Word documents. The results of the pilot will inform both the recommendations that TLAAC will release later this fall and the work of the CTL in supporting our faculty to make their course sites and teaching more accessible. Identifying, assessing and removing physical barriers to accessibility and inclusivity Starting in 2016, Concordia undertook a series of audits to determine how it could render 14 of its main buildings more accessible for people with disabilities by identifying, assessing, and removing barriers that can limit access to our campuses. Facilities Management completed accessibility upgrades as part of the major renovation projects to the following: Webster Library in the J.W. McConnell Building (LB 2 to 5), the Department of Education in the Faubourg Ste-Catherine Building (FG 1, 5, 6), the entire first basement level the Faubourg Tower (FB SS1), and the entire 6th floor of the Henry F. Hall Building (H-6). Ongoing work at the university addresses deficiencies, particularly in washrooms, entrances and vertical transportation in buildings on the Sir George Williams Campus and Loyola Campus. Compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines The Concordia University website is developed and maintained in adherence with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA standards. The university is committed to making its site accessible to all internet users so that they can navigate and access information on the Concordia website regardless of disability, device or technical constraint. WCAG standards include ensuring that documents shared on any digital platform are created with accessibility in mind. This means creating accessible PDF and Word documents with captions for graphics, images and photos, as well as producing videos with captioning that can be read and accessed by assistive technologies such as screen readers for people with disabilities. These guidelines are continually updated by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international community that works together to develop web standards. Learn more by taking part in university events and activities As part of the work underway to further improve accessibility at Concordia for people with disabilities, the Office of the Provost and the Equity Office will host a series of activities and events this fall and winter. This series is intended to keep you updated, answer your questions, and hear your thoughts on the work that we’re undertaking to ensure that all students, faculty and staff can more fully participate in the Concordia experience. Details will be communicated very shortly. Your input will help create a stronger, more diverse and accessible university  Working towards our goal of universal accessibility requires everyone’s engagement, whether you are a person with disabilities or not. I encourage you to get involved in our present and future initiatives by visiting the Equity Office website to find out how you can increase your awareness and understanding of accessibility and contribute to the conversation. Thank you for your input, individual interest and team efforts in helping to make teaching, learning, research and working at Concordia an even more inclusive experience.

Call us at 848-2424, ext. 2608, 2609 or 2676.  When you will write your final exam Be sure to review all the university regulations concerning deferred examinations in the undergraduate calendar. When you write your deferred exam depends on: The date of the original examination The next session when the course is offered Your graduation status You will be notified by email of the acceptance of your deferral request and the exam session in which you will be writing your deferred exam.

Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science Deferred exams are only written at the end of the session when the course is offered. If you are a potential graduate and the course for your deferred exam is not offered in the term immediately prior to your graduation, a “special exam” will be provided for you and scheduled during the regular final exam period. John Molson School of Business Deferred exams are only written at the end of the session when the course is offered. If you are a potential graduate and the course for your deferred exam is not offered in the term immediately prior to your graduation, a “special exam” will be provided for you and scheduled during the regular final exam period. After you write the deferred exam Your exam will be evaluated and a grade submitted to the Office of the Registrar. The new grade submitted for you will replace the DEF notation on your record. A deferred examination counts for the same weight in the course evaluation scheme and covers the same course material as the original examination. If you fail a course after writing a deferred examination you may have one opportunity to write a supplemental examination during the next scheduled supplemental examination period. To have this privilege you must meet all the criteria for writing a supplemental exam and receive an original grade other than FNS. If you don’t write the deferred exam If you choose not to write the deferred exam, your “DEF” notation will be replaced by the original grade submitted for you and it will be calculated in your grade point average. You also forfeit the chance to write the missed exam. You must repeat the course if it is a requirement of your degree. An examination cannot normally be deferred a second time.  If you were prevented from writing the deferred exam due to extraordinary circumstances, you may apply to the University Examinations Committee for a retroactive discontinue notation (DISC) in the course. You would have to submit a second Request for a DEF notation application form along with the fee and provide supporting evidence. Please review the steps for how to apply for a DEF notation.  You may make requests for deferred examinations in a maximum of three exam sessions during your undergraduate or independent studies at Concordia.  Requests which exceed this number will be submitted to the University Examinations Committee for consideration only if they have been the consequence of extraordinary circumstances.

Michèle Deslauriers, the voice of the Montréal Métro, not to mention a puster extraordinaire, is back to congratulate passengers for decreasing the number of service disruptions across the underground network. Read her tips, and follow the STM on social media to help make your transit experience as easy as PIE lX. By acting responsibly, we make the métro more reliable. Here are the main causes of service disruption. *Videos in French olny.   1. Holding back the doors If the doors are closing, do not try to enter the car or hold back the doors for your friends. It slows everyone down, and you could also get a fine.   2. Dropping items on the tracks For your safety, stay behind the yellow line and hold onto your personal items. What should you do if you drop something on the tracks? Stay calm and do not put yourself in danger. Notify an STM employee, who will help you get it back.   3. Sick passengers If you don’t feel well, stay on the platform and ask for help. 4. Walking on the tracks Trains arrive in the stations at 72 km/h. Never go onto the tracks. It’s dangerous, and you could also get a fine of $500. What should you do if you see someone on the tracks? Locate the emergency assistance station on the platform. Pull the handle to shut off the power to the tracks and pick up the phone to notify an STM employee. Together, let's continue to do our part to reduce service disruptions.

Moodle allows teachers to organize and store course content in a secure web-based environment which their students can access from anywhere at any time. Teachers can post, collect, and grade assignments, administer quizzes, host online discussions, share resources and more. Related policy: Scope and guidelines for Moodle use Who can use it? Faculty, staff and students. How much does it cost? There is no cost associated with this service. How to get it Moodle courses are automatically created several weeks before the beginning of a semester. Teachers and students are added to the sites by an automatic process. How to access Moodle: Students can access their courses from the Student Hub's Moodle page. Faculty can access their courses and resources from Carrefour's Moodle page. Alternatively, you can log in directly at moodle.concordia.ca using your Concordia netname and password. Your courses will appear on the right-hand side in the My Concordia Courses block. Teachers/professors: Newly created courses are hidden by default. To access the hidden courses, click on 'More courses (including new courses)' below your visible courses. Service availability 24/7 Documentation Moodle course life cycle This documentation describes the life cycle of Moodle courses at Concordia University and applies to official courses students are enrolled in through the Student Information System (SIS). These standards comply with the records and retention guidelines concerning teaching materials. Course creation (one month before start of term) All Moodle courses are automatically created in an empty shell state. Instructors are assigned to their courses automatically. Prior to, or at the start of term, courses are made active (accessible to students) by instructors. Course completion (end of term) Following the end of term, courses remain on Moodle for 3 years. Instructors retain read/write access to courses during the 3 years. Students retain access the course for six months after the end of the term. Moodle server course removal (after 3 years) Each February, all Moodle courses over 3 years old are removed and stored in a non-live, non-accessible state for a period of 5 years. During the 5-year storage period, courses can be retrieved upon request by contacting the IT Service Desk. Following the 5-year storage period, courses will be permanently deleted with advance notice. How to download all instructor files from a Moodle course Instructors can download all instructional files in a Moodle course posted by a teacher or a teaching assistant. All files that have been posted on the course homepage or within the activities (such as assignment, forum, quiz, etc.), will be downloaded into one folder. *Note that student submissions and files will not be downloaded into the folder. Follow the steps below to download all instructional files for a course: Log into Moodle and go to the course from which you wish to download the files. Click on the  Adminstration Gear on the top right , click on Download instructor files. A zipped folder will be downloaded onto your computer (this will differ depending on your browser’s settings). Locate the folder and unzip it. All files will be contained in a single file without any sub-folder. Moodle user guides for students and staff Both students and staff will find helpful information on the Moodle homepage. Teachers/professors have access to various handouts on Help For Instructors page. This page requires authentication using your Concordia netname and password. Teaching & learning technologies – which software to choose Which software should you choose? To help you choose among the various technologies available to support your teaching and learning, consider this chart. If you want to do the following: Consider this technology: Here’s a bit more about the technology Record the lecture and related slides and images for a traditional class while you’re teaching the class (and make the recording available immediately afterwards to students) through Moodle YuJA YuJa is a video management system that records classroom lectures and captures related slides and images.  This type of software is especially useful for large lectures.  These recordings provide students who have difficulty following the original lecture with an opportunity to review the class session.  Access is provided to students through Moodle.  When reviewing the recordings, second-language learners have stated that they can catch points missed in the original lecture.  Other students have commented that the recordings are useful resources when studying for quizzes and exams. YuJa can be added in your Moodle courses. Conduct a regular class at the regularly scheduled time but online because (a) I am traveling one or more weeks out of the term, (b) The class is scheduled at an awkward time and many students will have difficulty making class on time each week, or (c) I want to regularly include guests in other locations in the class Web conference with Zoom Zoom is a software that lets instructors and students meet online at the same time in a virtual classroom.  In the classroom, instructors can lecture; interact with students through voice, chat, and poll questions; share slides, documents and other resources; and let students work in groups, even though they are located in different places.  Instructors can record the session and make the recording available to students to review later through YuJa. Zoom can be added in your Moodle courses. “Flip” my class: that is, ask students to complete their readings and view recorded lectures through Moodle before the class session and use class time to work through problem sets or similar activities and answer questions YuJa Flipped courses are ones in which instructors record lectures and expect students to view them before the class session, so instructors can use class time to work through problems and exercises or similar application activities.  Access is provided to students through Moodle. YuJa is a software that allows users to record lectures and host large videos and files like narrated PowerPoint slide presentation. YuJa also lets users edit the recordings so that they can have the most visual and audio impact. Because it is easy to use, makes recordings, allows closed captioning and allows for easy editing of the video and audio tracks, YuJa is ideally suited for preparing the recordings used in flipped courses. Communicate regularly with students outside of class throughout the term Moodle Moodle is software that lets instructors communicate with students outside of the classroom.  A flexible system, instructors use Moodle for one or more of these tasks: sharing announcements; distributing course-related materials—including recordings for the flipped classroom; submitting student assignments; conducting quick polls; and conducting class-related discussions outside of class time. Student FAQ How do I access Moodle? Students can access their courses from the Student Hub's Moodle page. Faculty can access their courses and resources from Carrefour's Moodle page. Alternatively, you can log in directly at moodle.concordia.ca using your Concordia netname and password. Your courses will appear on the right-hand side in the My Concordia Courses block.

Your list of courses will appear on the right-hand side in My Concordia Courses block. I am a registered student trying to access Moodle but it is not working. What can I do? In order for the course to be accessible to students on Moodle, teachers must ""activate"" it.  If you are unable to see the course,  contact your teacher to ensure he/she has activated it.

This page explains when you may apply for a MED notation, how to do it, and when you will write your replacement final exam. Be sure to review all the university regulations concerning “MED” notations in the undergraduate calendar. Read regulations concerning MED notations What does an MED notation mean? A MED notation on your transcript indicates that you were unable to write a final examination and/or complete other assignments due to a long-term medical situation. A MED notation provides a student with two options. The student can either write the deferred exam or keep the MED notation on their transcript. A MED notation does not affect the GPA. If the student decides to write the deferred exam, the final grade in the course will replace the MED notation on the transcript. A long-term medical condition is an illness or condition that has been ongoing throughout the term and has severely interfered with your ability to complete course assignments or write the final exam. You cannot apply for a MED notation if you experience a short-term illness just before the exam or the exam period, but you may apply to defer your exam. Learn more about DEF notations. Eligibility for MED notations You may apply for a MED notation if you missed a final exam and/or cannot complete other assignments due to long-term illness. Check your transcript when you apply for a MED notation. Your transcript must show one of these grade options listed below: An original grade (A,B,ect) and the DNW (Did Not Write) notation if you missed the final exam An original grade (A,B, ect) and the INC (Incomplete) notation if you did not submit all the necessary term work An original grade (A,B,ect) with the DNW/INC notations if you missed both the final exam and did not submit all the necessary term work We cannot process your application if you receive one of the following grades: R NR If you believe you have received a failing grade in error, you must discuss your situation with the instructor. How to apply for a MED notation Be sure to review all the university regulations concerning MED notation in section 16.3.8 II in the undergraduate calendar. Read section 16.3.8 II Step 1 Apply online using the following link: Apply now for the MED notation If you are unable to apply online, you may also download and print the Request for “MED” Notation form. You can also pick up the form at the Birks Student Service Centre (LB-185). By submitting a MED notation application, you agree to the terms and conditions that are outlined on the MED request form. Step 2 Submit your application by the deadline. If you submit your application online, please note that the processing fee of $37.25 will be charged to your student account. Term Deadline Fall January 15 Fall/Winter (6-credits) or Winter May 10 Summer August 31 Always submit the request form before the deadline. If you are missing any of the documents to support your request, you may submit them afterwards. You can email any supporting documents to examsoffice@concordia.ca. Make sure you include your full name and student ID number in your email. Step 3 Collect your supporting documents and submit them as soon as possible. If you cannot have the Medical Physician Form provided by Concordia completed by your physician, you can submit other additional documentation. These documentations must be on a physician’s original letterhead. While the nature of your medical condition does not need to be explained, we do require an indication of the range of dates when you were unable to perform schoolwork during the academic year. You can email any supporting documents to examsoffice@concordia.ca. Make sure you include your full name and student ID in your email. All applications must be submitted along with a statement explaining the situation and the reasons for the request. All statements should be maximum one page long. If you are applying online, you will find space to submit this statement on the online MED notation application form. A member of the Exams Office may be in contact with you to request additional information regarding your application. Step 4 Wait for us to process your request. We only begin processing requests as soon as the official examination period is over and your final grade has been recorded. All requests will receive a notice on the decision of the application. Step 5 If your request is approved, you will receive further information regarding your MED notation and be granted the option of writing a replacement examination. Be sure to review all the university regulations concerning replacement examinations in section 16.3.7 II in the undergraduate calendar. If your request is denied, you will receive information regarding why, and further documentation can be provided. If further documentation is provided, your application will be re-assessed. You may also visit Concordia’s Health Services Department where they can assess your medical condition and offer assistance. If you repeatedly submit medical certificates, the university reserves the right to refer you to a university-appointed physician for a recommendation. INC notations Be sure to review all the university regulations concerning INC notations and late completion of course work in section 16.3.5 in the undergraduate calendar. You must complete any outstanding assignments and submit them by the deadline: Term Deadline Fall February 15 Fall/Winter (6-credits) or Winter May 30 Summer September 15 Check with your instructor; some may have earlier deadlines than those stated above.   Incomplete course work and INC notations If you have been granted an INC notation for outstanding assignments, but you feel that you cannot complete these assignments due to a long term illness, do apply for a MED notation. The MED notation has no grade point value in the calculation of a student’s GPA. The MED notation will stay on a student’s Concordia transcript if the assignments/requirements are not submitted and/or the deferred final exam is not written. If a student chooses to have the MED notation remain, and the course is required for their degree, they would be required to re-register for it at a future date.

When you write your replacement exam depends on: The date of the original examination The next session when the course is offered Your graduation status You will be notified by email of the acceptance of your MED request and the exam session in which you will be writing your replacement exam. Please ensure your email address on file is up to date. Details of your exam date, time and location will be listed in your Student Exam Schedule once the exam schedule is available for the term in which you are writing.

John Molson School of Business Deferred exams are only written at the end of the session when the course is offered. If you are a potential graduate and the course for your deferred exam is not offered in the term immediately prior to your graduation, a “special exam” will be provided for you and scheduled during the regular final exam period. After you write the replacement exam Your exam will be evaluated and a grade submitted to the Office of the Registrar. The new grade submitted for you will replace the MED notation on your record. A replacement examination counts for the same weight in the course evaluation scheme and covers the same course material as the original examination. If you fail a course after writing a replacement examination you may have one opportunity to write a supplemental examination during the next scheduled supplemental examination period. To have this privilege you must meet all the criteria for writing a supplemental exam and receive an original grade other than FNS. If you don’t write the replacement exam It depends on the situation. If you choose not to write the replacement exam, your “MED” notation will stay on your record and the course will not be calculated in your grade point average. You also forfeit the chance to write the missed exam. You must repeat the course if it is a requirement of your degree. If you were prevented from writing the replacement exam due to extraordinary circumstances, you may apply to the University Examinations Committee. You would be required to provide documentary evidence in support of your request and submit a second “Request for a “MED” notation” application form along with the fee.

Low back pain is the most common musculoskeletal problem that requires medical attention — an estimated 80 per cent of adults will experience it at least once in their lifetime. But its underlying sources often remain a mystery, and it continues to confound medical professionals, researchers and, of course, sufferers. Researchers, including some at Concordia, have over the past several years changed their focus in their search for answers. While much prior research has looked at different spine structures as possible sources of pain, more attention is now being paid to the lower back muscles using MRI imaging. It’s the topic of a new paper published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports by researchers at Concordia and Western University in London, Ontario. In it they explain how they used statistical shape analysis to look at the shapes of a particular lower back muscle in chronic back pain sufferers as a potential biomarker for the condition. It is the first time this technique has been used to study the morphology — essentially the shape and structure — of the paraspinal muscle. Maryse Fortin and Yiming Xiao: “Statistical shape analysis allows us to detect very localized changes in muscle shapes related to low back pain.” “Statistical shape analysis allows us to detect very localized changes in muscle shapes related to low back pain,” says the paper’s lead author Yiming Xiao, an assistant professor of computer science and software engineering. After factoring in variables such as age and sex, Xiao says, “this study can help detect where specifically the muscles are degenerating. And that can help formulate a more targeted physiotherapy plan to strengthen those muscles and ease suffering.” Maryse Fortin, an assistant professor in the Department of Health, Kinesiology and Applied Physiology, co-authored the paper, along with Hassan Rivaz, an associate professor and Concordia University Research Chair of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Joshua Ahn, an undergraduate at Western and Terry Peters and Michele Battié, professors at Western. Currently, the inter-institute research collaboration is working on medical image analysis methods, including artificial intelligence technology that allows automatic diagnosis and prognosis of painful spinal disorders, such as disc herniation. Two sides of the same muscle The researchers look at unilateral lumbar disc herniation, which manifests as pain on the same side as the herniation. Essentially, this occurs when one side of the spinal disc bulges, potentially irritating the nerve root. By examining participants suffering only from pain on one side, they had access to pathological and healthy muscles in the same body, which draws a clearer comparison because they can exclude complex variables such as life habits from consideration. “We were able to find signature shape variations in the multifidus muscle between the painful and the non-painful sides,” Xiao says. “And compared to the classic ways of measuring muscle functions, such as the overall size of the muscle and fatty infiltration, we found that our method was more sensitive to detecting the differences.” Defining terms Fortin says the technique also helped the researchers determine whether the shape of the multifidus muscle was a biomarker for potential back pain. Previous studies often had conflicting results because there was no uniformity in methodology of analysis. For example, researchers were using different muscle segmentation protocols, so the definition of muscle groups would begin and end at different places depending on the study. Degenerative change of the back muscles due to natural aging also complicates matters. This can cloud potential biomarkers and mask sources of pain, as degenerative change does not necessarily result in discomfort. “Here with MRI, we have a three-dimensional view of the muscle’s shape, and it takes into account parameters that have not been studied yet,” she says. “We found variations in shapes from female to male, as well as associated with age and with ontology. So it really is a novel idea.” Read the cited paper: “Statistical morphological analysis reveals characteristic paraspinal muscle asymmetry in unilateral lumbar disc herniation.” Related topics 	 Press Release 	 	 health 	 	 PERFORM 	 	 Research subjects 	 You might also like: Researcher Maryse Fortin investigates cause and treatment of lower back pain Concordia researcher investigates lower back pain in hockey players Trending Concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the Montreal Climate Partnership November 10, 2021 Improvements to Concordia’s Henry F.

Copyright management tools are designed for different types of creators, from occasional uploaders to established media companies. Our copyright management tools include: Copyright takedown webform Copyright Match Tool Content Verification Program Content ID By default, the copyright takedown webform is available for everyone on YouTube to use. The availability of the other copyright management tools is based on: Demonstrated need for frequent copyright management Available resources to manage your rights and content Knowledge of YouTube’s copyright system While we work to expand the availability of our tools, we’re also committed to protecting against significant disruptions that can result from their misuse. For infrequent copyright management Copyright takedown webform Everyone with a YouTube Account has access to our copyright takedown webform. If your copyright-protected work is uploaded without your permission, you can use our webform to submit a copyright takedown to request the content be taken down from YouTube. For most copyright owners, the webform is the fastest and easiest way to request a copyright takedown. The copyright owner, or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf, should submit the webform. Learn more about the submitting a copyright takedown request. For frequent copyright management To find the right tool for your frequent copyright management needs, start by filling out this form. Make sure you're signed in with the same YouTube account you've previously used to submit takedown requests through our webform. Your responses will give us more info about your needs for copyright management so we can find the tool that’s right for you. Once you submit the form, we’ll review your responses and email you our recommendations based on: How often you upload videos How often your videos are reuploaded Whether you manage an account on behalf of a company Your history of submitting requests through our webform. Specifically, how your previous webform requests show an understanding of copyright and a need for frequent takedowns. More info on our tools for frequent copyright management can be found below: Copyright Match Tool The Copyright Match Tool can automatically identify videos that are copies or potential copies of other videos on YouTube. The tool finds videos that match other videos that were already uploaded to YouTube or taken down due to a takedown request. Once matches are found, you can choose actions to take, such as: Emailing the uploader of the matched content Requesting a removal of the content Archiving the match The Copyright Match Tool uses the same matching technology as Content ID, but it’s easier to manage and requires fewer resources. Learn more about the Copyright Match Tool. Content Verification Program If you often need to remove content and have previously submitted many valid takedown requests, you may be eligible for our Content Verification Program. The program gives copyright owners a tool to search for content they believe is infringing and request takedowns for many videos at once.  If you don’t need to search and remove many videos on an ongoing basis, the copyright takedown webform is the best option. Learn more about the Content Verification Program. Content ID Content ID is available to copyright owners with the most complex copyright management needs, such as record labels or movie studios. To qualify for Content ID, copyright owners must have previously submitted many valid takedown requests and have the resources to manage Content ID, among other criteria. Content ID is a matching system that automatically identifies content that may be infringing. When videos are uploaded to YouTube, they’re scanned against a database of files submitted by copyright owners. If Content ID finds content that matches one of your works, you can choose actions to take, such as: Block a whole video from being viewed Monetize the video by running ads against it, sometimes sharing revenue with the uploader Track the video’s viewership statistics These actions can be specific to a country/region. For example, a video may be monetized in one country/region, and blocked or tracked in another. Learn more about Content ID. Notes:  Even unintentional misuse of Content ID can have serious consequences for YouTube and creators. Content ID comes with complex controls that require ongoing management and an advanced understanding of copyright. Copyright owners who use Content ID must also make sure their content is eligible for Content ID and safe for automated matching technology. Many copyright owners prefer to use a third-party service provider to manage their rights using Content ID. These Content ID service providers act on behalf of copyright owners for a fee. You can find one in this directory. Keep in mind: Using any of these copyright management tools to submit a takedown request starts a legal process. Misuse of any of these tools, such as submitting false information, may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences. Before submitting takedown requests, it’s important to consider whether fair use, fair dealing, or other exceptions to copyright applies in each situation.

Acute care This refers to the care of a patient for a brief but severe episode of illness, for conditions that result from disease or trauma, or during recovery following surgery. Acute care is generally provided in a hospital. Accident Under the emergency care and travel assistance outside your province of residence, this refers to any event due to sudden and unforeseeable external causes that inflicts bodily injuries which are certified by a physician, directly and independently of any other cause. It does not mean any form of disease, or degenerative process, en inguinal, femoral, umbilical or incisional hernia, or any infection other than an infection of a visible, external cut or wound accidentally sustained. Annual base salary This refers to your annual earnings as an employee, excluding overtime, stipends or any supplementary earnings. Average gross weekly earnings This amount is used to determine benefits under the Short-Term Disability Plan. It is equal to 108% of the dollar value of your contract (to account for vacation pay) divided by the scheduled number of weeks in the contract. B Beneficiary This is the person whom you designate to receive benefits under the Basic Life Insurance, Optional Life Insurance and Optional Accident Insurance Plans, in the event of your death. If you do not designate a beneficiary, the benefits will be paid to your estate. Benefit Year Under the Health Plan, this refers to: if you are a part-time faculty employee: either January to December or September to August, depending on your teaching contract; if you are not a part-time faculty employee: January to December. C Coma or comatose Falling into a coma or becoming comatose means being in a profound stupor or in a state of complete unconsciousness. Commuted value The lump-sum calculated to pay you the amount you would need today to buy the pension promised by the plan at your retirement, assuming that this amount is invested and earns a reasonable rate of return from now until retirement. This calculation is very complex - it involves a number of assumptions and can only be performed by an actuary. Consumer Price Index (CPI) An annual measure of the change in the cost of living, based on the price increases of a fixed “basket” of goods and services bought by Canadian consumers. The measurement of the CPI is monitored by Statistics Canada. Continuous service Uninterrupted employment since your date of hire, including certain qualified periods of leave. Contributory member When you join the Pension Plan for the Employees of Concordia University, you automatically become a non-contributory member and earn benefits without having to contribute to the plan. However, you may choose to become a contributory member and, in turn, earn more benefits. You may change from contributory to non-contributory membership, and vice versa, each January 1. To do so, simply inform Benefits Services by the end of November in the preceding year. Convalescent hospital A convalescent hospital is an institution that: provides recuperative care; is eligible to receive payments under and in accordance with the provisions of the Provincial Hospital Act; is operated according to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which it is located; has a licensed physician and registered nurses in attendance 24 hours a day; is regularly engaged in providing room and board and skilled nursing care for sick or injured persons during the convalescent stage of a sickness or injury; and maintains a daily record of each patient under the care of a licensed physician. Credited service Your membership in the Pension Plan for the Employees of Concordia University from the date you joined the plan to the date of your retirement, termination of employment, death, or termination of participation as an active employee in the plan, including: service transferred from another plan; periods of disability while eligible for or receiving benefits from an employer-sponsored long-term disability plan; periods of disability while receiving Workers’ Compensation benefits, provided you are making contributions; and periods of approved pregnancy/parental leave, provided the employee continues regular contributions. If you are not a full-time employee, your credited service in a calendar year will be determined as the ratio of your actual earnings during the plan year to the earnings scheduled to be earned by full-time employees in the same employment category, provided that the ratio does not exceed 1.

These types of ads cannot be controlled from within YouTube Studio. Back-to-back ads Also referred to as ad pods, two back-to-back video ads can occur when you turn on skippable or non-skippable ads on your video. This kind of ad format only displays on longer form video content (at least 5 minutes in length) on the platforms mentioned in the table above.  Ad pods help reduce interruptions for viewers of longer videos, resulting in a better viewer experience.  Ads on shorter videos Video ads may be less likely to serve on short videos.

Information for... Future students Student hub Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search News Meat substitutes are still tricky to market to consumers despite pandemic growth, Concordia paper finds Product descriptors and packaging colours can lead to unexpected consumer perceptions of sustainability, healthiness and satiety November 23, 2021 | By 		Patrick Lejtenyi The plant-based/meat alternative market has been growing for years, but it was during the pandemic that its profile soared. Meat substitutes remain relatively niche products, however. So how can its proponents break through to consumers? Caroline Roux, associate professor of marketing at the John Molson School of Business, and Daniella Sucapane (MSc 20) recently published a­ paper on the topic in the journal Appetite. In it, they argue that a particular combination of product descriptors and packaging colours can appeal to the flexitarian consumer — those who lean toward vegetarianism but who still enjoy the odd meat-based meal. But there are lessons marketers should heed when it comes to this particular industry. Along with fellow assistant professor of marketing Kamila Sobol, the researchers conducted two studies that looked at how descriptors and colours affected consumer behaviour. In the first, they tested how they responded to the terms “plant-based” and “meat alternative,” two common industry descriptors. In the second, they looked at how packaging colours affected consumers’ perceptions and behavioural intentions. Daniella Sucapane and Caroline Roux: “Certain cues can unknowingly sway perceptions of different products.” Meanings to digest For study 1, the researchers looked at how the terms “plant-based” and “meat alternative” affected perceptions of a product’s healthiness, eco-friendliness, ethicality, expected enjoyment and satiety (how satisfied they would feel after eating it), as well as their likelihood to try it and how much of it they would eat. They recruited 148 participants for a five-minute online study, excluding vegetarians and vegans, since research has shown that they can react negatively toward meat-based cues. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Each group was given almost identical descriptions of a pea-protein patty made by the Canadian company Lightlife, except that the product was described as “plant-based ground” for one group and “meat alternative ground” for the other. Front-of-package labelling identified each as either “Made from plants” or “Meat made from plants” respectively. The packaging’s colour was changed from the usual red to the more neutral brown. Participants were then asked to rate the products on a variety of scales from one to seven. “Participants said that they felt that the plant-based product was healthier and more environmentally friendly than the meat alternative,” Sucapane says. They also indicated they were more likely to try plant-based food but that they would eat less of it. They did not find effects regarding ethicality, enjoyment or satiety. Study 2 tested whether product packaging colour affected the results found in study 1. The researchers wanted to see how participants would evaluate a product with green packaging — a colour closely associated with eco-friendliness and healthy living — and one with red packaging, which is more evocative of meat and tastiness. Using the same evaluation method, a new set of participants was assigned to one of four experimental conditions. Two were “matched” with “green-plant based” and “red-meat alternative,” while two others were “mis-matched” with “red-plant based” and “green-meat alternative.” The results were surprising, according to the researchers. They found that the participants were more likely to consider the matching red-meat alternative more eco-friendly than the mis-matching green-meat alternative, and increased trial likelihood. The matching green-plant based descriptor was associated with decreased anticipated feelings of satiety. No effects were found on perceptions about health, ethicality or expected enjoyment. An evolving marketplace “You really got the idea that adding colour adds another layer of complexity to simply using terms like plant-based or meat alternative,” says Roux, Concordia University Research Chair in Psychology of Resource Scarcity. She explains that the study can be used as a word of caution to marketers, who may not fully appreciate the consequences of adding particular colours to particular product descriptors, especially in new markets like meat substitutes. “It is a category that is still being transformed and trying to find its space in the retail environment,” she adds. “Sometimes it is found alongside products like tofu or veggie burgers, the traditional first generation of meat substitutes. In other cases, you will find it in the meat section. These are very different reference points that marketers should consider, as certain cues can unknowingly sway perceptions of different products.” Read the cited paper: “Exploring how product descriptors and packaging colors impact consumers’ perceptions of plant-based meat alternative products.” Packaging design and plant-based meat alternatives Related topics 	 Research subjects 	 	 Press Release 	 	 sustainability 	 You might also like: Public Scholar Tanya Singh wants to better understand the impacts of consumer indecision Concordia student startup is a semi-finalist in the global XPRIZE Feed the Next Billion competition Trending Concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the Montreal Climate Partnership November 10, 2021 Improvements to Concordia’s Henry F.

This is thanks in large part to guidance and feedback from community members. Now the team is hoping to receive more input through a new survey. For the last few months, the team has been meeting with neighbourhood groups and other organizations, City of Montreal officials and students, faculty and staff members. Fruitful discussions “Along with a thorough study and review process, consultations and integrated design sessions kept us busy the last few months,” says Marie-Claude Lavoie, associate vice-president of Facilities Management. To communicate the process, Concordia sent out 11,585 postcards to neighbours of both Sir George Williams and Loyola campuses and shared links to a consultation platform through web, email and social media platforms. The university also reached out to officials and organizations with expertise that ranged from transportation and sustainability to heritage and inclusion. “We tried to get the word out to all those with a stake in the future of our campus grounds and buildings,” Lavoie shares. “We organized three group sessions and 17 one-on-one discussions for those with specific interests or expertise, including transportation providers like BIXI, the STM and EXO.” Some sessions took place over the summer months but, by using web-based tools, people could have their say from anywhere with a Wi-Fi connection. New lenses for evaluating projects Thanks to these conversations and written submissions, the Master Plan team identified lenses through which space planning should be considered moving forward: “Indigenization, sustainability, inclusivity, health and well-being and university identity are fundamental considerations that we will apply to our planning for both campuses,” Lavoie notes. Moving forward There are a number of stages remaining along the path to a new Campus Master Plan. While coordination continues with the City of Montreal — a partner in the process — there are some areas where community priorities will help Facilities Management’s Strategic Planning and Development unit make choices. For example, the new survey will help define the different options for improved sustainability, mobility and health and well-being scenarios. “Answers will help us make choices for our campuses and also indicate to the city what the larger community values most in an urban setting.” To have your say about Concordia’s Campus Master Plan, visit the engagement profile and select the survey. Those without a profile can quickly create one with their name and email address. Community members can also reach out to Strategic Planning and Development about other Campus Master Plan ideas by emailing: master.plan@concordia.ca.   Related topics 	 facilities 	 	 community 	 You might also like: New research, teaching and collaboration spaces open at Concordia’s Gina Cody School From pool to school: six new classrooms in the FB Building basement are ready for students Concordia’s redesigned Hall 6 is a model for future campus projects Trending Concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the Montreal Climate Partnership November 10, 2021 Improvements to Concordia’s Henry F.

To avoid confusion, Super Chat and Super Stickers aren’t available on live streams with Live Chat Donations. Creators can't host a members-only live chat with the donate button. How do nonprofits get the donations? Google partners with Network for Good to collect and distribute the donations at Google’s request. 100% of your contribution goes to the nonprofit and YouTube will pay transaction fees. As required by the U.S. IRS, Network for Good has exclusive legal control over the donations once collected. If Network for Good cannot disburse the funds to the YouTube creator’s nonprofit, Network for Good will distribute the funds to another qualified U.S. nonprofit. Learn more about how Network for Good disbursements work. What if the nonprofit designated to get my donation becomes ineligible? If Network for Good, Google's donor advised fund partner, can't distribute funds for a project to the intended nonprofit for any reason (including that the nonprofit is not a valid United States 501(c)(3) organization), Google will work with Network for Good to select an alternate qualifying nonprofit. How do I see donations in my live chat? You’ll see donations appear in the chat window. You can also monitor live chat donations in real time in the Live Control Room with the Viewer Activity Widget.  What do the amount total and progress bar represent? The amount total represents the funds raised for that fundraiser in total, from all channels and videos participating in the fundraiser.

Go to YouTube Studio. Go to Monetization.  Select Giving. Under “Total Raised,” you’ll see basic fundraiser data next to campaigns you have joined or created.  Hover over the amount raised with your mouse to see more details about your fundraiser.  Nonprofit FAQs  What nonprofits are eligible to be fundraised for with YouTube Giving? To be eligible to get money from a YouTube Giving fundraiser, a nonprofit must: Be requested by a creator. Be a US-registered 501(c)(3) Public Charity. Be opted into online fundraising via GuideStar. Follow YouTube’s monetization policies both on and off YouTube. This requirement includes following YouTube’s Community Guidelines. Note: Private foundations are not currently supported.  What if I don’t see the nonprofit I want to request in the request tool?

The nonprofit can request a Google for Nonprofits account. The nonprofit is not a Guidestar registered US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Look them up on guidestar.org to confirm the nonprofit is there. The nonprofit has opted out of online fundraising. Nonprofits must give the OK for donors to fundraise for them online. Learn more about raising money as a nonprofit on YouTube.

Some requests can take up to 5 business days. To help speed up the process, make sure the nonprofit you’re requesting meets the eligibility criteria.  How are funds distributed to Nonprofits? We partner with Network for Good, a U.S. 501(c)(3) and donor advised fund, to collect and distribute the funds to the nonprofits. Typically Network for Good disperses funds on a monthly basis.

Learn more about Live Chat Donations.  Which countries/regions can donate to a YouTube Giving fundraiser? If you're located in the following countries/regions, you can make donations.

Can I get a refund on my donation? Voluntary donations to nonprofits are non-refundable. If you're having trouble making a payment, you may get in touch with our support team. What info do you share with the nonprofits when I make a donation? When you make a donation, your contact info isn’t shared with the non-profit or creator. If you make a “public” donation when giving on live chat, the creator hosting the live stream can see your account name and donation amount. Learn more about how your info is used. What are user, company, and offsite donations? User donations: Funds given by YouTube users. Company donations: Funds given by YouTube or another company, as verified by the nonprofit. Offsite donations: Funds collected by the organizer and verified by the nonprofit on a site other than YouTube as part of this campaign. How does company matching work? If a company has pledged to match donations, they’ll donate $1 for every $1 given to a fundraiser via the YouTube Donate button. This matching will continue until the full match is met or the end of the campaign, whichever comes first.

Latest Updates [00:50 UTC 23 April 2021] Protecting our extended workforce and community: Due to increased COVID-19 infections in certain parts of the world, we will continue to rely more on technologyto quickly identify and remove content that violates our Community Guidelines. [17:30 UTC 17 November 2020] Update to COVID-19 information panels: As a continuation of our efforts to combat COVID-19 related misinformation, we’re updating our COVID-19 information panels to include links to COVID-19 vaccine info. The updated panels may show in search results and on watch pages related to COVID-19 or COVID-19 vaccine info. The updated panels are intended to help users find third-party authoritative COVID-19 vaccine info and are not a judgment on the accuracy of any video. [20:20 UTC 11 August 2020] Premieres: Due to a surge in YouTube Premieres during COVID-19, some channels are temporarily limited to posting Premieres at 15 minute intervals (like 1:15 or 1:45 instead of 1:30 or 2:00). [17:00 UTC August 10, 2020] Depression and anxiety information panels available in more countries We’ve launched health information panels on depression and anxiety in 27 more countries. These panels first launched in the US on July 13, 2020 to give easy access to authoritative mental health info during the COVID-19 pandemic. [16:30 UTC 13 July 2020] New health information panels for depression and anxiety: The COVID-19 pandemic not only affects physical health, it can also affect mental health. To help people access authoritative information more easily, we’re introducing depression and anxiety health information panels and self-assessments in YouTube Search. The panels and self-assessments are currently available in the U.S. and we hope to make the panels available in more countries/regions soon. [23:15 UTC 11 June 2020] Update to the COVID-19 health panel self-assessment: The self-assessment in the COVID-19 health panel now links to Google's self-assessment screener, which is based on CDC guidelines. The self-assessment screener gives users more info on what kind of support or medical care might be appropriate for them. [17:38 UTC 20 MAY 2020] COVID-19 Misinformation policy: YouTube has updated its Community Guidelines to include a page on COVID-19 misinformation, which can be found here. [23:34 UTC 30 April 2020] COVID-19 health panel self-assessment: To help people make decisions about seeking appropriate medical care, we’ve launched a link to a COVID-19 self-assessment in our COVID-19 health panel in Search. We’re starting by launching this in the U.S., partnering with the Center For Disease Control, and will roll out to more countries soon. [18:00 UTC 13 April 2020]  We’re introducing a destination button on the Explore tab for content from creators participating in the #StayHome #WithMe campaign. This page will highlight some of our creators who have used video to help people learn, connect and entertain during this time. [16:00 UTC April 1 2020] COVID-19 health panels: Starting today, we’re launching additional health panels for COVID-19 that show in search results for COVID-19 related searches. These panels include text-based health info from the WHO and NHS, and content like symptoms, prevention and treatment. During this time, we want to continue to prioritize local health sources, so you may see both an information panel with a link to a local health authority and the COVID-19 health panel. [18:14 UTC 2 April 2020] Monetizing COVID-19-related content: We’ve expanded monetization of content mentioning or featuring COVID-19 to all creators and news organizations. As always, content must follow both Advertiser-Friendly and Community Guidelines.  [17:00 UTC 16 March 2020] Protecting our extended workforce and community: We are taking the steps needed to prioritize the wellbeing of our employees, extended workforce, and the communities where they live, including reducing in-office staffing in certain sites. We will start relying more on technology to help do some of the work normally done by reviewers, which may result in some accidental removal of content that does not violate our policies. This may affect additional types of YouTube user and creator support and reviews, such as applications for the YouTube partner program or responses on social media. Coronavirus and YouTube: Answering Creator Questions Further information on updates: Monetization  [18:14 2 April 2020] Monetizing COVID-19-related content: We’ve expanded monetization of content mentioning or featuring COVID-19 to all creators and news organizations. As always, content must follow both Advertiser-Friendly and Community Guidelines.  Here are some guidelines for uploading COVID-19-related content: Fact check your work. Use reputable sources from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and National Health Service to inform your content.  Be sensitive to the fact this is an ongoing global crisis. We ask that if you choose to share COVID-19 related-content, you do so with the best intentions in mind. Please do not leverage this event for the selling or promotion of products or services. Follow both Advertiser-Friendly and Community Guidelines. All monetizing content is subject to our Ad Friendly Guidelines and Community Guidelines. If your content violates these policies, it will be removed or receive limited or no ads. For specific examples of COVID-19 related content that isn’t eligible for monetization, check out this Help Center article.  If your content doesn’t follow these guidelines, we may limit monetization on your COVID-19-related content, or in rare cases, temporarily disable monetization on your channel. Note: You may still see yellow icons on new uploads as these systems learn and are tuned to allow for broader monetization of coronavirus content. Please appeal if you feel your content is in line with our updated policies so our teams can review and update accordingly. [16:27 UTC 25 March 2020] Expect Delays - Merch shelf item reviews​:  If you are new to merch on YouTube, please note that you may not be able to enable the merch shelf and related features until our review capacity returns to normal. If you’re already live with the merch shelf and want to add new merchandise items or modify the name or description of existing ones, you may need to wait longer than usual for those items to be reviewed and approved for display on your channel. [16:53 UTC 20 March 2020] Expect Delays - YPP application reviews:  As we’ve already shared, we’re taking the steps needed to prioritize the health of our extended workforce, including reducing in-office staffing in certain sites, to reduce the spread of COVID-19. As a result, it will likely take longer than one month to hear back about your application to YPP. You can continue to check your application status here.  We’re working with our partner companies to enable our extended workforce to be online at home where possible, including shipping laptops around the world, and ensuring they’re connected to the internet. As we take the steps needed to support the health of our extended workforce, we’ll strive to review as many videos and process as many applications as possible. We appreciate everyone’s patience during this challenging time, and will keep the updates coming as this progresses.     [19:00 UTC 18 Mar 2020] Channel memberships perk reviews: As we take steps to prioritize the wellbeing of our extended workforce, reviews of creators’ perks for their channel memberships are likely to take much longer than usual. This means:   You may not be able to launch memberships until our review capacity returns to normal. If you’ve already launched and want to change your perks, you may need to wait longer than usual for those changes to be approved. For channels that need to change channel memberships perks, you can communicate the changes to your audience through a video and/or a Community post. You can also create or update an intro video. All channel membership perks you offer — whether or not they're included in the perks listed on your offer screen — are subject to membership policies and guidelines. [14:40 UTC 16 March 2020] Monetizing COVID-19-related content: We’re expanding the monetization of content mentioning or featuring COVID-19 to more creators and news organizations. If you’re a creator, you’ll receive a notification in YouTube Studio when this change has gone into effect for your channel. Here are some guidelines for uploading COVID-19-related content: Fact check your work. Use reputable sources from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and National Health Service to inform your content.  Be sensitive to the fact this is an ongoing global crisis. We ask that if you choose to share COVID-19 related-content, you do so with the best intentions in mind. Please do not leverage this event for the selling or promotion of products or services. Follow both Advertiser-Friendly and Community Guidelines. All monetizing content is subject to our Ad Friendly Guidelines and Community Guidelines. If your content violates these policies, it will be removed or receive limited or no ads. For example, content that claims, harmful substances or treatments can have health benefits or content that violates our violent or graphic content policies is considered violative and will be removed. We want to help you provide your viewers with high-quality content on this topic, and following the guidelines above will help ensure you do so.  If your content doesn’t follow these guidelines, we may limit monetization on your COVID-19-related content, or in rare cases, temporarily disable monetization on your channel.   [16:00 UTC 11 March 2020] Updates to monetization for coronavirus-related content: Currently, the coronavirus situation is considered a “sensitive event”. Our sensitive events policy was designed to apply to short-term events of significant magnitude, like a natural disaster. Due to the ongoing nature of this situation, we’ll begin enabling ads for content discussing the coronavirus on a limited number of channels. This will include creators who accurately self-certify and a range of news partners, with more channels to follow. We’re preparing our policies and enforcement processes to expand monetization to more creators and news organizations in the coming weeks.   Policy and Copyright  [17:38 UC 20 MAY 2020] COVID-19 Misinformation policy: YouTube has updated its Community Guidelines to include a page on COVID-19 misinformation, which can be found[17:00 UTC 16 March 2020] Protecting partners and our extended workforce: We have teams at YouTube as well as partner companies that help us support and protect the YouTube community–from people who respond to user and creator questions, to reviewers who evaluate videos for possible policy violations. We are taking the steps needed to prioritize the wellbeing of our employees, extended workforce, and the communities where they live, including reducing staffing at certain sites. With this change, we will start relying more on technology to help do some of the work normally done by reviewers. This means automated systems will start removing some content without human review. As we do this, users and creators may see increased video removals, including some videos that may not violate policies. We won’t issue strikes on this content except in cases where we have high confidence that it’s violative. As always, if you believe that your content was removed in error, you can appeal, but do note that our workforce precautions may also result in delayed appeal reviews.  The situation with coronavirus continues to change day by day, and we’ll continue to take the steps needed to protect our teams and the communities where they live. This may affect additional types of YouTube user and creator support and reviews, such as applications for the YouTube partner program or responses on social media. Thank you for your patience while we take the steps needed to protect our workforce.  Creator support  [18:00 UTC 19 March 2020] I’m a YouTube Creator, how can I help? Many Creators have asked us how you can help with the evolving COVID-19 situation, and right now one of the best things you can do to help yourself, your family & friends, and your community in the days ahead is to slow the rate of infection by staying home as much as possible.  As a YouTube Creator, here’s something you can do now → Spread the word to stop the spread - #StayHome.  If you choose to use YouTube to share content urging people to #StayHome, consider videos that are helpful, fun and informational and tag #StayHome and ___ #WithMe (e.g. #StayHome and cook #WithMe or #StayHome and learn #WithMe). For inspiration, check out our channel.  We’re also adding a destination page on the Explore tab for content from creators participating in the #StayHome and ___ #WithMe campaign. This page will highlight some of our creators who have used video to help people learn, connect and entertain during this time. [16:00 UTC 17 March 2020] Longer than usual support response: As we take steps to prioritize the well-being of our extended workforce, expect longer than usual wait times for responses to questions across all forms of support including email, chat, and social. Events and Spaces  [22:35 UTC 18 February 2021] An update on YouTube Spaces: Since announcing a temporary closure of our physical YouTube Spaces early last year due to the pandemic, we’ve focused our partner programming and plans to reach more creators and artists through virtual events. To better meet the needs of our ever growing community into the future, we’re reimagining YouTube Spaces. Read the latest in our blog. Paid product support  [23:48 UTC 17 March 2020] Longer-than-usual response times on support: Due to to the recent global health crisis related to COVID-19, we’re operating with a limited team. See your options to connect with a support specialist, or consult the Help Center. Viewer updates [17:00 UTC August 10, 2020] Depression and anxiety information panels available in more countries: We’ve partnered with authoritative sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) to launch depression and anxiety health information panels in 27 more countries. For a list of these countries and the authoritative sources we’ve partnered with, see our Health Information Panels article. These information panels were first introduced in the US on July 13, 2020 to give users easy access to authoritative mental health info during the COVID-19 pandemic. Info such as symptoms and treatment options for depression and anxiety appear in the panels. This info can help users make informed decisions about whether to seek support or medical care. We hope to continue making the panels available in more countries/regions soon. [16:30 UTC 13 July 2020] New health information panels for depression and anxiety: The COVID-19 pandemic not only affects physical health, it can also affect mental health. To help people access authoritative information more easily, we’re introducing depression and anxiety health information panels in YouTube Search. We’ve partnered with the Mayo Clinic to launch the panels, which show information on symptoms and treatment options for depression and anxiety. In the U.S., the depression and anxiety health panels link to clinically validated Google self-assessments. The self-assessments give users more info on what kind of support or medical care may be appropriate for them. The panels and self-assessments are currently available in the U.S. and we hope to make the panels available in more countries/regions soon. [23:15 UTC 11 June 2020] Update to the COVID-19 health panel self-assessment: In April, we launched a COVID-19 self-assessment in our COVID-19 health panel in YouTube Search. The COVID-19 self-assessment now links out to Google's self-assessment screener, which is based on CDC guidelines. The self-assessment screener gives users more info on what kind of support or medical care might be appropriate for them. It is available in the U.S. and will roll out to more countries soon. [23:34 UTC 30 April 2020] COVID-19 health panel self-assessment: To help people make decisions about seeking appropriate medical care, we’ve launched a link to a COVID-19 self-assessment in our COVID-19 health panel in Search. We’re starting by launching this in the U.S., partnering with the Center For Disease Control, and will roll out to more countries soon. The COVID-19 health panel links out to the CDC’s self-assessment screener on the CDC website, where users can answer questions to inform recommendations about what kind of medical care might be appropriate. [16:00 UTC April 1 2020] COVID-19 health panels: Starting today, we’re launching additional health panels for COVID-19 that show in search results for COVID-19 related searches. These panels include text-based health info from the WHO and NHS, and content like symptoms, prevention and treatment. During this time, we want to continue to prioritize local health sources, so you may see both an information panel with a link to a local health authority and the COVID-19 health panel. [13:30 UTC 24 March 2020] Update on adjusted bandwidth usage: Last week, we temporarily defaulted all videos on YouTube to standard definition in the  European Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland (CH). Given the global nature of this crisis, we are expanding that change globally starting today. This update is slowly rolling out. You can manually adjust the video quality of any video you're watching on a computer, TV, or mobile device. We will continue working with member state governments and network operators to minimize stress on the system, while also delivering a good user experience. [21:16 UTC 20 March 2020] Adjusted bandwidth usage: As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, more people come to YouTube to find authoritative news, learning content, and make connections. We have measures in place to automatically adjust our system to use less network capacity. We’re temporarily defaulting all traffic in the  European Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland (CH) to Standard Definition. You can manually adjust the video quality of any video you're watching on a computer, TV, or mobile device. We will continue working with member state governments and network operators to minimize stress on the system, while also delivering a good user experience. [21:35 UTC 19 March 2020] COVID-19 news shelf: A COVID-19 news shelf may now show on the YouTube homepage. The shelf includes news videos about COVID-19 from authoritative news publishers and local health authorities on our platform. The content in this shelf is populated algorithmically, using hundreds of signals, including relevance to COVID-19, how up-to-date it is, and region. You may not see the COVID-19 news shelf if a Breaking News or Top News shelf is already showing. You can always dismiss the COVID-19 News shelf on the homepage. [16:00 UTC 17 March 2020] Longer than usual support response: As we take steps to prioritize the well-being of our extended workforce, expect longer than usual wait times for responses to questions across all forms of support including email, chat, and social. [16:00 UTC March 11 2020] Info panels: Starting in February, we launched info panels that drive users to the World Health Organization or to local resources that reflect local government guidelines. The panel will be visible on the YouTube homepage, in Search for queries related to coronavirus, as well as on the watch page for videos related to coronavirus. We’ll donate ad inventory to governments and NGOs in impacted regions to use for education and information. Community and comments [20:20 UTC 20 March 2020] Community posts: Due to the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on our workforce, Community posts are temporarily unavailable on some channels. This will not result in any new Community Guidelines strikes or penalties on your account. Some Community Posts flagged by users or our automated systems may not be available on the homepage or in recommendations while waiting for our reviewers to take a closer look. As a result, these posts may receive less engagement than usual.

We will also continue to quickly remove videos that violate our policies when they are flagged, including those that discourage people from seeking medical treatment or claim harmful substances have health benefits. Finding trustworthy content is especially critical as news is breaking, and we’ll continue to make sure YouTube delivers accurate information for our users. I’m a YouTube Creator, how can I help? Many Creators have asked us how you can help with the evolving COVID-19 situation, and right now one of the best things you can do to help yourself, your family & friends, and your community in the days ahead is to slow the rate of infection by staying home as much as possible. This is that ""social distancing"" and “flattening the curve” you keep hearing about (read more here). Of course there are individuals, including healthcare and government workers (some of whom are Creators themselves), who are critical to maintaining support systems across our communities who still need to leave their homes to travel to-and-from work, and we thank them for all that they’re doing during this time. For the rest of us, it is individual actions that can help protect the most vulnerable people among us. Authoritative health & safety organizations are urging people to stay home when possible, so we can create a safer environment for those who are at the greatest risk from the virus. So seriously, please stay home.

Some metrics seem similar, but their differences are important for understanding your YouTube ad revenue.  RPM Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is a metric that represents how much money you’ve earned per 1,000 video views. RPM is based on several revenue sources including: Ads, Channel memberships, YouTube Premium revenue, Super Chat, and Super Stickers.   Why is my RPM lower than my CPM? RPM is lower than CPM because RPM: is calculated after YouTube's revenue share  includes all views, including ones that weren’t monetized The amount of revenue you make hasn't been changed as part of addition of the RPM metric.   What’s the difference between RPM and CPM? CPM is the cost per 1000 ad impressions before YouTube revenue share. RPM is your total revenue (after YouTube's revenue share) per 1000 views. RPM CPM Creator-focused metric Includes total revenue reported in YouTube Analytics including ads, YouTube Premium, Channel Memberships, Super Chat, and Super Stickers Includes total number of views from your videos, including the ones that did not monetize The actual revenue earned after revenue share.  Advertiser-focused metric Includes only revenue from ads and YouTube Premium Includes only views from the videos that monetized (i.e ads were shown) Earnings before revenue share Why is RPM important? RPM lets you see how much money you're earning per 1,000 views. It also helps you understand how effective your monetization is overall. How can I increase my RPM? To improve your RPM you should improve your total revenue. Here are some steps to maximize RPM:  Turn on monetization on all videos Turn on all ad formats Turn on ads at eligible positions (for example, midrolls) Turn on AltMon features (for example, memberships, Super Chat) to diversify your revenue streams. Keep in mind that each feature has its own requirements and guidelines.  If my RPM is going up or going down, what does it mean? RPM is a snapshot of the rate at which you’re earning money on YouTube. If it goes up, it means you’re earning more money for every 1000 views, and if it goes down, you’re earning less. Note that your RPM may go down when there’s an increase in unmonetized views, even if your revenue was the same. Whether RPM goes up or down, it’s a good indication of what is or isn't working in your revenue strategy. Understanding what influences RPM can help you identify opportunities to improve your monetization strategy. What doesn't RPM tell me about my revenue? RPM is a useful monetization metric for creators, but it can’t tell your whole revenue story. Here’s what it doesn’t include: Revenue made from selling merchandise or using the merch shelf Revenue made through brand deals and sponsorships (excluding YouTube BrandConnect) Any other revenue generated indirectly through YouTube (services, speaking, consulting fees) RPM can’t tell you which revenue source is responsible for swings in your overall revenue Because RPM combines several metrics, it can’t tell you which revenue source is responsible for swings in your revenue. For example, you might see a decrease in RPM because your views may be up, but not all are ad-enabled views. Or you may see your RPM go up with no significant change to views because viewers are signing up for Channel Memberships. We recommend you use all the different analytics YouTube gives to help you fully understand changes in your RPM. Watch and learn about RPM To learn more about RPM, check out the following video from the YouTube Creators channel.  New Monetization Metric: Revenue Per Mille (RPM) CPM Cost per 1,000 impressions (CPM) is a metric that represents how much money advertisers are spending to show ads on YouTube. You’ll see a few different CPM metrics in YouTube Analytics: CPM: The cost an advertiser pays for 1,000 ad impressions. An ad impression is counted anytime an ad is displayed. Playback-based CPM: The cost an advertiser pays for 1,000 video playbacks where an ad is displayed.  What’s the difference between CPM and playback-based CPM? Videos on YouTube can have more than one ad. CPM focuses on the advertiser cost for ad impressions. Playback-based CPM focuses on the advertiser cost for video playbacks that include one or more ads. Your playback-based CPM is often higher than your CPM. For example, say your video is viewed 5,000 times. 1,000 views included one ad and 500 other views included two ads, for a total of 1,500 views with ads. This instance means there were 2,000 individual ad impressions, but only 1,500 monetized playbacks. Let’s say the advertiser paid $7 total. The video’s cost per impression would equal the $7 advertiser cost divided by the 2,000 ad impressions, or, $0.0035. The CPM, or cost per 1000 impressions, would then equal $0.0035 times 1,000, or, $3.50. The playback-based CPM would equal $7 divided by the 1,500 monetized playbacks, times 1,000, or $4.67. Why is CPM important? You get a cut of what advertisers pay when an ad serves on your video. The more an advertiser pays for that ad, the more money you make. Your CPM is a good indicator of how valuable advertisers find your videos and audience for achieving their own business goals. Your revenue will not be equal to your CPM times your views because CPM reflects what advertisers pay, not what you earn. Also, not all views will have ads. If they aren’t advertiser-friendly, some videos are ineligible for ads altogether. Other video views may not include ads due to lack of available ads. Views that included ads are referred to as monetized playbacks. Why is my CPM changing? Fluctuations in your CPM over time are normal, and happen for many reasons, such as: Time of year: Advertisers tend to bid higher or lower depending on the time of year. For instance, many advertisers bid higher just before holidays. Changes in viewer geography: Advertisers can control which geographies they’d like to reach with their ads. Different locations will have different levels of competition in the ad market, so CPMs will vary by geography. If there’s a shift in where most of your views are coming from, you may see a shift in CPM. For instance, if you previously had views from a geography with higher CPMs, but are now getting more views from geographies with lower CPMs, you may see a decrease in your CPM. Shifts in distribution of available ad formats: Different ad types tend to have different CPMs. If, for instance, there are more available non-skippable ads in the ad inventory, CPM might be higher. Estimated revenue vs. ad revenue  Estimated revenue: Revenue from all revenue types including channel memberships, YouTube Premium revenue, and Super Chat. You’ll see this metric on the Revenue tab. Estimated ad revenue: Revenue just from ads on your videos. You’ll see this metric in the revenue sources report. Views, ad impressions, & estimated monetized playbacks Views: The number of times your video was watched. Ad impressions: The number of times individual ads were viewed on your videos. Estimated monetized playbacks: The number of times your video was watched with ads. If your video is viewed 10 times, and 8 of those views contained ads, you would have 10 views and 8 estimated monetized playbacks. If one of those estimated monetized playbacks actually had 2 ads, you would have 9 ad impressions. Not all views on YouTube have an ad. A view may not have an ad if: The video is not advertiser-friendly. Ads or individual ad formats are turned off for that video. There isn’t an ad available to show to that particular viewer. Advertisers can choose to target specific devices, demographics, and interests. Your viewer may not match this targeting. Learn more about available targeting methods for video ads. A range of other factors, including the viewer’s geography, how recently they’ve seen an ad, whether they have a Premium subscription, and so on. Because of these different views, you’ll likely have more views than estimated monetized playbacks.

Director Leslie Baker will lead an ensemble of Concordia students; 21 performers and a team of designers, in the creation of this performance inspired by the Oresteia. The Six Viewpoints and a physical approach to acting will inform the creation process.  The final piece will employ physicality, sound, text and image to articulate the content of this collaged creation. Set in a minimalist landscape, a highly viscerally expressive chorus will lead us through an event that explores ancient and contemporary experiences of rage and the cyclical nature of revenge.   Note that tickets will be available online only one week before the event.  Due to additional front of house procedures related to COVID, we encourage you to show up well in advance of the show.

This has placed a significant financial burden on many Montrealers — especially those already living in vulnerable conditions. And with the city’s homeless population doubling during the pandemic, the crisis has pushed an even greater number of people into risk. Since the outset of the pandemic in March 2020: 24,000 women have left the Quebec labour market 264,000 jobs have been lost in Greater Montreal The city’s largest food bank has seen a 30 per cent jump in demand That’s where Centraide of Greater Montreal comes in. Formed in 1966, Centraide’s mission “is to make the most important social issues such as poverty and exclusion unignorable and provide everyone with the means to build inclusive communities and improve the quality of life for the most vulnerable.” Funds to Centraide support: 350 community agencies and projects across Montreal, Laval and the South Shore Some 800,000 people in need To specifically counter the pandemic’s fallout, Centraide established the four emergency funds, which to date have allocated $25.6 million to some 635 agencies. “The crisis has made Centraide’s support for frontline community organizations such as foodbanks, women’s shelters and after-school programs more crucial than ever,” says Concordia President Graham Carr. “These organizations are committed to meeting the special needs and challenges of their clientele. And, to put it simply, they can’t operate without our contributions. Beyond that,  Centraide’s support enables people to be active participants in the society of Greater Montreal,” he adds. “I’m heartened to see the generosity Concordians have shown to various causes over the past 18 months — and I know that, together, we’ll do our part for Centraide this year, too.” Concordians’ support The university community is once more being asked to do its part. Concordia’s 2021 Centraide Campaign kicks off on October 12 and runs until November 12. “This is our 47th campaign. Since 1975, Concordians have consistently stepped up to make a difference by giving to Centraide, and I know we’ll do so again this year,” says campaign co-chair Nadia Bhuiyan, vice-provost of partnerships and experiential learning. “Last year we set our sights high with a goal of $170,000 — and yet, incredibly, we raised over $220,000. Clearly that shows our community’s commitment.” “While our city has recovered somewhat from the worst days of the pandemic, our at-risk population is a long way from being out of the woods,” says fellow campaign co-chair Philippe Beauregard, chief communications officer. “That’s why we’ve set another high target — $200,000 — for the Concordia campaign. Those funds will directly benefit a range of needy Montrealers, including vulnerable children, isolated seniors, people with disabilities, the homeless and those who have lost their income,” he says. “Give to Centraide. Your gift will support Montrealers in need.” Join fellow Concordians for a virtual trivia night on October 21, to help raise funds for the Centraide campaign. And look for more information on the Let’s Get Moving for Centraide! challenge soon. Pledge your gift to Centraide today. Online giving is secure and easy. Look for your personalized giving link in your email inbox from Centraide@unclic, starting October 12.

If you're looking for info about Community Guidelines strikes, which are different than copyright strikes, go to our Community Guideline strikes basics. If you get a copyright strike, it means that a copyright owner submitted a complete and valid legal takedown request for using their copyright-protected content. When we get this type of formal notification, we take down your video to comply with copyright law. A video can only have one copyright strike at a time. Keep in mind that videos can be removed from the site for reasons other than copyright. Also, Content ID claims don't result in a strike. Deleting a video with a strike won’t resolve your strike. Learn how to resolve a copyright strike below. What happens when you get a copyright strike We all make mistakes. When you get a copyright strike, it acts as a warning. The first time you get a copyright strike, you’ll need to go through Copyright School. Copyright School helps creators understand copyright and how it’s enforced at YouTube.  Copyright strikes may affect your ability to monetize. In addition, if your active live stream is removed for copyright, your access to live streaming will be restricted for 7 days. If you get 3 copyright strikes: Your account, along with any associated channels, is subject to termination. All the videos uploaded to your account will be removed. You can't create new channels. Courtesy Period If your channel is part of the YouTube Partner Program, you're eligible for a 7 day courtesy period. After 3 copyright strikes, you'll have 7 additional days to act before your channel is disabled. During this period, your copyright strikes won’t expire and you can't upload new videos. Your channel will remain live and you can access it to seek a resolution for your strikes. If you submit a counter notification, your channel won't be disabled while the counter notification is unresolved. If the counter notification is resolved in your favor, or the claim is retracted, your channel won't be impacted. How to get info about your strike Sign in to YouTube Studio. From the left menu, click Content. Filter  for Copyright claims. Hover over “Copyright claim” in the Restrictions column and click SEE DETAILS. Resolve a copyright strike There are three ways to resolve a copyright strike: Wait for it to expire: Copyright strikes expire after 90 days. If it's your first strike, you'll need to complete Copyright School. Get a retraction: You can get in touch with the person who claimed your video and ask them to retract their claim of copyright infringement. Submit a counter notification: If you think your video was removed by mistake, or qualifies as fair use, you can submit a counter notification. Watch to learn more Check out the following video from the YouTube Creators channel to learn the basics of copyright strikes.

Overview No refund will be granted for any course(s) for which the student has or will receive a grade, including grade notations, e.g. discontinued (DISC), etc. Once a student has enrolled in a Master’s/Magisteriate or Ph.D. program and is registered for a course or a course notation, e.g. CIP, STOQ, he/she is responsible for the payment of the resulting fees. 2. Withdrawal from a course(s) Master’s and PhD students are not granted a refund of fees paid, or a financial credit on account, when they officially withdraw from a course before or after the DNE withdrawal deadline. Students should refer to the Graduate Calendar for further information about the official procedure to withdraw from a course. 3. Withdrawal from a Master's or PhD program A full refund of fees paid, or a financial credit on account, will be granted to students who officially withdraw from their degree program before the published DNE withdrawal deadline. Students who withdraw from their degree program after the DNE withdrawal deadline will not receive a refund of fees paid, or a financial credit on account. Students should refer to the Graduate Calendar for further information about the official procedure to withdraw from a Master’s or PhD program. Not attending classes, not paying tuition, or simply informing the instructor of one’s intent to withdraw does not constitute official withdrawal from the course or program of study, nor does it entitle the student to a refund of fees paid, or a financial credit on account. In the event that a student has not yet made payment and withdraws after the DNE deadline, the student will be held financially responsible for the payment of the resulting fees. Tuition and all compulsory fees charged for previous academic terms are non-refundable.

Requesting a refund Students may leave a credit on their student account and it will automatically be applied to fees owing in the next semester(s). All refunds under $10 will only be refunded by Interac (debit card) at the Birks Student Service Centre, S-LB-185. All refunds of $75 and more will be refunded via the original payment method (debit, credit card or cheque). All refunds must be submitted online through the Student Centre. You can also access your Student Centre by logging in to the Student Hub and going to My CU Account. Once in the Student Centre, select Finances > other financial. Use the drop down menu to select Refund Request. Please note, when requesting a refund on the Student Centre,  “Cheque” is set as a default option. If a student request a cheque refund, it  is automatically made payable to the student, unless the student asks that a cheque refund be made payable to a third party, e.g. a parent, spouse, etc.  In that case, the student must provide the name and mailing address of the third party payee. When the refund pertains to the current academic term, the refund will only be processed after the covering deadline for withdrawal with full refund (DNE deadline).  Verification of the student's account may take some time, especially during peak refund request periods.  A cheque refund is normally mailed within 10 business days of the deadline for withdrawal with full refund (DNE) deadline and the student's online request. International students requiring a refund by wire transfer must be submitted online through the Student Centre. You can also access your Student Centre by logging in to the Student Hub and going to My CU Account. Once in the Student Centre, select Finances > other financiall. Use the drop down menu to select Refund Request. A wire transfer refund is normally processed within 10 business days of the deadline for withdrawal with full refund (DNE) deadline and the student's online request. The student will assume the cost of the wire transfer. The cost of the wire transfer will be deducted from the amount of the refund transferred by wire. Please note that requests for wire transfers to a Canadian or U.S. bank will not be processed. Canadian and U.S. students must submit a cheque Refund Request as noted above. 5.

Our services include:Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google HomePlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating systemProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google MapsYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.Information Google collectsWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our servicesWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.Things you create or provide to usWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.Information we collect as you use our servicesYour apps, browsers & devicesWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed.Your activityWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:Terms you search forVideos you watchViews and interactions with content and adsVoice and audio information when you use audio featuresPurchase activityPeople with whom you communicate or share contentActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our servicesChrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google AccountIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.Go to Google AccountYour location informationWe collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you.Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:GPSIP addressSensor data from your deviceInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devicesThe types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices.In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.Why Google collects dataWe use data to build better servicesWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:Provide our servicesWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.Maintain & improve our servicesWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.Develop new servicesWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.Provide personalized services, including content and adsWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.Go to Ad SettingsMeasure performanceWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.Communicate with youWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.Protect Google, our users, and the publicWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.Your privacy controlsYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's usedThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.

(Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).Unique identifiersA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.Additional Contextads you’ll find most usefulFor example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.advertising and research services on their behalfFor example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.Android device with Google appsAndroid devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.combine the information we collectSome examples of how we combine the information we collect include:When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. Learn moreIf you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. Learn moreThe Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based your activity. Learn moreIf you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. Learn morecustomized search resultsFor example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.deliver our servicesExamples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube videoWe use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google AccountPhotos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, animations, and other creations that you can share. Learn moreA flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your GmailWhen you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.detect abuseWhen we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.devicesFor example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.ensure and improveFor example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.ensure our services are working as intendedFor example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.Information about things near your deviceIf you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn morelegal process, or enforceable governmental requestLike other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.make improvementsFor example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.may link informationGoogle Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn morepartner with GoogleThere are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. Learn morepayment informationFor example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn morepersonalized adsYou may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn morephone numberIf you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn moreprotect against abuseFor example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).publicly accessible sourcesFor example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s language models and build features like Google Translate. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.rely on cookies to function properlyFor example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn moresafety and reliabilitySome examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn moresensitive categoriesWhen showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like ""Cooking and Recipes"" or ""Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services.Sensor data from your deviceYour device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.servers around the worldFor example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users.services to make and receive calls or send and receive messagesExamples of these services include:Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemailGoogle Meet, for making and receiving video callsGmail, for sending and receiving emailsGoogle Chat, for sending and receiving messagesGoogle Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messagesGoogle Fi, for a phone planshow trendsWhen lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.

You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.specific partnersFor example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. Learn more about these partners and how they use your information.synced with your Google AccountYour Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. Learn morethe people who matter most to you onlineFor example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently.third partiesFor example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.Views and interactions with content and adsFor example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.your activity on other sites and appsThis activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.Learn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.Change language:AfrikaansBahasa IndonesiaBahasa MelayuCatalàČeštinaDanskDeutschEestiEnglishEnglish (United Kingdom)EspañolEspañol (Latinoamérica)EuskaraFilipinoFrançaisFrançais (Canada)GalegoHrvatskiIsizuluÍslenskaItalianoKiswahiliLatviešuLietuviųMagyarNederlandsNorskPolskiPortuguês (Brasil)Português (Portugal)RomânăSlovenčinaSlovenščinaSrpskiSuomiSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάБългарскиРусскийСрпскиУкраїнська‫עברית‬‫اردو‬‫العربية‬‫فارسی‬አማርኛमराठीहिन्दीবাংলাગુજરાતીதமிழ்తెలుగుಕನ್ನಡമലയാളംไทย한국어中文 (香港)中文（简体中文）中文（繁體中文）日本語GoogleAbout GooglePrivacyTermsGoogle appsMain menu"

Moreover, the public release of the source code of popular malware families such as Mirai [1] has spawned diverse variants, making it harder to disambiguate their ownership, lineage, and correct label. Such a rapidly evolving landscape makes it also harder to deploy and generalize effective learning models against retired, updated, and/or new threat campaigns. To mitigate such threat, there is an utmost need for effective IoT malware detection, classification and family attribution, which provide essential steps towards initiating attack mitigation/prevention countermeasures, as well as understanding the evolutionary trajectories and tangled relationships of IoT malware. This is particularly challenging due to the lack of fine-grained empirical data about IoT malware, the diverse architectures of IoT targeted devices, and the massive code reuse between IoT malware families. To address these challenges, in this thesis, we leverage the general lack of obfuscation in IoT malware to extract and combine static features from multi-modal views of the executable binaries (e.g., images, strings, assembly instructions), along with Deep Learning (DL) architectures for effective IoT malware classification and family attribution. Additionally, we aim to address concept drift and the limitations of inter-family classification due to the evolutionary nature of IoT malware, by detecting in-class evolving IoT malware variants and interpreting the meaning behind their mutations. To this end, we perform the following to achieve our objectives: First, we analyze 70,000 IoT malware samples collected by a specialized IoT honeypot and popular malware repositories in the past 3 years. Consequently, we utilize features extracted from strings- and image-based representations of IoT malware to implement a multi-level DL architecture that fuses the learned features from each sub-component (i.e, images, strings) through a neural network classifier. Our in-depth experiments with four prominent IoT malware families highlight the significant accuracy of the proposed approach (99.78%), which outperforms conventional single-level classifiers, by relying on different representations of the target IoT malware binaries that do not require expensive feature extraction. Additionally, we utilize our IoT-tailored approach for labeling unknown malware samples, while identifying new malware strains. Second, we seek to identify when the classifier shows signs of aging, by which it fails to effectively recognize new variants and adapt to potential changes in the data. Thus, we introduce a robust and effective method that uses contrastive learning and attentive Transformer models to learn and compare semantically meaningful representations of IoT malware binaries and codes without the need for expensive target labels. We find that the evolution of IoT binaries can be used as an augmentation strategy to learn effective representations to contrast (dis)similar variant pairs. We discuss the impact and findings of our analysis and present several evaluation studies to highlight the tangled relationships of IoT malware, as well as the efficiency of our contrastively learned fine-grained feature vectors in preserving semantics and reducing out-of-vocabulary size in cross-architecture IoT malware binaries. We conclude this thesis by summarizing our findings and discussing research gaps that lay the way for future work.

Information for... Future students Student hub Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search News Celebrity couples help each other navigate the ultimate gig economy, new Concordia research shows A spouse’s social capital is a valuable commodity in an industry where the biggest names own little other than their appeal December 7, 2021 | By 		Patrick Lejtenyi From Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall to Tom Holland and Zendaya, the Hollywood celebrity couple has always been an object of fascination and envy. But how does the Hollywood celebrity function as a business venture? Project-based industries like film and television rely heavily on networks: the adage “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know” applies as much now as ever. In a study published in the journal Family Business Review, three Concordia researchers look at how celebrity marriages can affect both partners’ career prospects. The researchers examined how a spouse’s professional network can help boost career outcomes, from more roles to ascending managerial ranks on the film production side. The study combines family business theory with network theory and is applied to a unique industry that prizes celebrity capital as a vehicle for economic capital. “Our motivation was determining whether or not marrying someone in the same field will help further a career when the whole industry is based on temporary projects,” says Yasaman Gorji, an assistant professor of management at the John Molson School of Business and the study’s lead author. “Does this kind of support exist, and could it help women especially shatter the glass ceiling?” Michael Carney, Concordia University Research Chair in Management, and Rajshree Prakash, an assistant professor of management, co-authored the paper. Yasaman Gorji: “Their spouse's networks help women get projects but not necessarily rise in the hierarchy.” Rising stars get a boost Gorji’s research began with the construction of a massive database of film industry personalities and couples dating back to the late 19th century, at the inception of cinema. For this study, she limited her analysis to some 1,200 couples who were active between 1970 — toward the end of the studio system era and the birth of a more diffuse and independent Hollywood — to 2010. These subjects were considered core crew members, either in front of or behind the camera, and had established careers in the years prior to marriage. Noting that the industry they are studying has a distinct hierarchy, the researchers designated one spouse as supporting and one receiving: one was leveraging his or her clout to support the other’s career. True to Hollywood’s reputation of being male dominated, the supporting spouse is more often male and the receiving female. To determine the effects of the marriage on the careers of the subjects, the researchers studied data from five years prior to marriage to three years following it. They also tracked career roles, moving either upwards from acting into producing or directing, downwards from producing and directing into strictly acting, writing or other roles, or no change in role in the three years after marriage. Controls for age at the time of marriage, gender and industry experience were considered in the data analysis. The receiver’s role type before marriage, marriage termination type, if any (separation, divorce or death) and Oscar wins before marriage were also controlled. Closed groups get more work They found that the size of a spouse’s professional network did have an impact on a receiver getting cast in more projects. But they benefitted more from access to networks that were tightly knit rather than those that were loose and wider cast.   “We often see content producers working recurrently with one another,” Carney says. “It’s like an ongoing team. We didn’t look for that, but we did find evidence that access to cliques or relatively closed networks was more helpful than having people who could bridge large numbers.” They also noted that men were more likely to move into directing and producing after marriage than women. The researchers add that there was no evidence that women gained more from a marriage than men in moving up hierarchies into producing or directing. “This paper is important because it brings up the idea of the hybridized family,” Gorji explains. “They are in the same business but do not own a firm. But they are helping each other get more  projects. Their networks help them get those projects but not necessarily rise in the hierarchy.” Read the cited paper: “Celebrity Couples as Business Families: A Social Network Perspective.” Related topics 	 Research subjects 	 	 Press Release 	 You might also like: Meat substitutes are still tricky to market to consumers despite pandemic growth, Concordia paper finds Trending Concordia sets new emissions targets — and supports the Montreal Climate Partnership November 10, 2021 Improvements to Concordia’s Henry F.

As part of YPP, creators can start monetising their content, receive email and chat support and get access to the Copyright Match Tool to help protect their content. A key eligibility requirement for YPP is to follow the YouTube monetisation policies, which include YouTube's Community Guidelines, Terms of Service and the Google AdSense programme policies. These policies apply to a creator's channel as a whole, and not just to individual videos. Setting a higher bar for monetisation Over the last few years, YouTube has taken steps to strengthen the requirements for monetisation so that spammers, impersonators and other bad actors can't hurt the ecosystem or take advantage of good creators producing high-quality content. To apply for membership in YPP, channels must meet eligibility thresholds related to watch time and subscribers. Following application, YouTube's review team ensures that the channel has not gone against YouTube's monetisation, content and copyright policies. Only channels that meet eligibility thresholds and follow all of our guidelines will be admitted to the programme, which makes them eligible to receive access to ads and other monetisation products. Resources Learn more about YouTube Partner Programme eligibility Learn more about YouTube channel monetisation policies Learn more about how data helps creators track their performance on YouTube Advertiser-friendly content guidelines Just because a creator is allowed to monetise, it doesn't mean that all videos on their channel will be eligible to have ads. Each video must also comply with our advertiser-friendly content guidelines. This is by design, as we understand that there are important conversations that have a place on YouTube, such as discussion of mental health or sensitive world events, that might not be deemed brand suitable by advertisers. Other examples of content that is not suitable for ads include some forms of inappropriate language, violence, adult content and harmful acts. To help creators understand which videos on their channel are suitable for ads, we have worked closely with advertisers to create clear and comprehensive advertiser-friendly content guidelines. Eligible creators also have the ability to self-rate their content per these guidelines and turn on ads monetisation for individual videos on their channel. Resources Review advertiser-friendly content guidelines What action does YouTube take for videos that do not comply with the advertiser-friendly content guidelines? If a creator has turned on ads monetisation for a video, but our reviewers and automated systems identify that the video does not comply with our advertiser-friendly content guidelines, the video will have limited or no ads appear against it. However, if creators believe that their video is still suitable for all brands, they can request human review of that video.

Four Concordians explain why the need to support the campaign is more urgent than ever Until Nov. 12, there are many ways to give October 27, 2021 | By Howard Bokser The success of the Concordia Centraide Campaign through the years is down to people. On the giving side, it’s the donors, the volunteers, the leadership. And on the receiving end, it’s about the millions of Montrealers who have benefitted from the support Centraide of Greater Montreal — many whose needs have become more pressing than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic of the past year and a half. Four Concordia staff and faculty share what it means to be part of the Concordia Centraide Campaign 2021, which runs to November 12. Dianne Cmor Associate University Librarian, Teaching and Learning, Library I have been with Concordia for four years. I oversee a number of Library services that support teaching and learning, and try to identify new ways for the Library to support the changing needs and practices of students and instructors. I have represented the Library on Concordia’s Centraide Campaign Committee for the past few years and am a regular donor via payroll deduction. I support Centraide because of the work of so many of its funded organizations that are focused on compassion and dignity for all, especially the most vulnerable among us. Last year, Centraide was able to quickly provide emergency funds to support people who were most severely affected by COVID-19. Poverty, housing insecurity, mental health, isolation — supporting Centraide is a way for me to help in so many important areas, and to respond to the changing needs as they present themselves. Melanie Gudgeon Alumni Officer, Homecoming and Reunions and Athletics, University Advancement I have been with Concordia and the University Advancement team since 2008. I work to engage members of our alumni community and support the Campaign for Concordia: Next-Gen. Now., to help our students and advance their education. I’ve contributed to the Greater Montreal Centraide campaign for numerous years, through donations and/or by participating in activities that raise funds. This year I’m also volunteering for the Centraide Campaign Committee, one of 20 volunteers from across the university. Furthermore, this year a number of advancement volunteers and I are mobilizing our efforts to support the campaign. As a member of the University Advancement team, I’m well aware of the value of philanthropy. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the societal issues in Greater Montreal and, unfortunately, the arrival of the pandemic has exacerbated many pre-existing problems. That’s why I’m grateful that Centraide supports qualified partners in the field making a difference. These frontline staff immersed in communities are best equipped to provide impactful solutions to our most vulnerable. This year I’m donating to Centraide to bring meaningful change to individuals and families suffering from social isolation and neglect. Nadia Bhuiyan, Concordia Centraide Campaign Co-Chair Vice-Provost, Partnerships And Experiential Learning Professor, Department of Mechanical, Industrial and Aerospace Engineering I will have been at Concordia for 20 years this January. As a professor in the Department of Mechanical, Industrial and Aerospace Engineering, I conduct research in product design and development and supply chain management, among other topics, and apply my research in the fields of aerospace and health care. As vice-provost of partnerships and experiential learning, my role involves developing sustainable partnerships with industry, community organizations, governments and other organizations to offer valuable experiential learning opportunities to all of our students. Philippe Beauregard and I are now in our fourth year as co-chairs of the Concordia Centraide Campaign. I was quite honoured to have been asked to co-chair the campaign, and it was an easy yes for me. I truly believe in and value the social good done by Centraide. It helps so many individuals, organizations and communities that are in vulnerable situations, and it’s hard to ignore the dire needs these groups face. The organizations supported by Centraide benefit so many members of our communities, including many of our own students. The work Centraide does allows these organizations to focus on their core mission rather than spending valuable time trying to find resources to get the work done. Why not try to contribute whatever we can to help them reach and advance their goals? It really doesn’t take much out of our pocket to have a substantial impact on society. As well, making a contribution is easy — just a touch of a button. There’s no downside to giving to Centraide, and 85 cents of every dollar you give goes directly to helping someone in need. Andrea Clarke Senior Director, Community Engagement and Social Impact Andrea Clarke (BSc 09, MSc 12, MBA 16) began as senior director of community engagement and social impact in 2020. She provides strategic leadership to the Office of Community Engagement and SHIFT Centre for Social Transformation. Prior to arriving at the university, Clarke was executive director of Head & Hands, a community organization in Montreal’s Notre-Dame-de-Grace neighborhood committed to the empowerment and holistic well-being of youth and their communities. Head & Hands is among the 350 community organizations that receives funding from Centraide of Greater Montreal. The ability to have access to multi-year funding can be extremely stabilizing for organizations. While the funding landscape is changing, too often support if only available for projects which are expected to be novel, highly impactful and financial sustainable without relying on the funds being renewed.  Supporting Centraide is a great way for the Concordia community to come together for Montreal.  Community engagement and social impact have been a part of the university’s culture well before my role was ever created, and the Concordia community’s long history of supporting Centraide is one more example of that culture. It’s not too late to sign up for the Let’s Get Moving for Centraide! Challenge, which has already begun and ends November 12. Help the Concordia community reach the goal completing 1,000 kilometres by walking, jogging, cycling — any physical activity that enables you to track distance. Pledge your gift to Centraide today. Online giving is secure and easy. Look for your personalized giving link in your email inbox from Centraide@unclic, which arrived beginning October 12.

Information for...   Future students Student hub Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search Home 	 	  /  	 International 	 	  /  	 Academic visitors 	 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn How to come to Concordia as an academic visitor Each year, Concordia welcomes a number of academic visitors from around the world to its campus. ""Academic visitor"" refers to an individual who is not a registered Concordia student or postdoctoral fellow or who does not hold an academic or research appointment covered by the provisions of a collective agreement. There are generally two types of Academic Visitors at Concordia: ""Visiting Scholars"" are faculty members and research fellows at other institutions who are invited to campus by a Concordia faculty member to conduct collaborative research activities. ""Research Interns"" are undergraduate or graduate students who are invited to campus by a Concordia faculty member to conduct collaborative research activities. Activities academic visitors conduct on campus include: Research in collaboration with Concordia faculty Short-term teaching, seminars, lectures, or panels Exhibitions and performances Evaluators for graduate theses, examinations, performances, exhibitions Coming to Concordia as an Academic Visitor In accordance with the Policy on Academic Visitors (VPRGS-10), perspective Academic Visitors to Concordia should follow the steps described on this page. First, a Concordia professor must agree to host you on campus for a specific project and set period of time AND be willing to obtain the necessary approval from her or his department in order for you to be issued an official Letter of Invitation to Concordia. Where applicable, she or he must also be willing to pay the required Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada’s (IRCC) $230 employer compliance fee of $230 using either a Concordia corporate card or their own credit card so that an IRCC Offer of Employment may be issued so you can apply for a work permit.  Concordia University does not cover this fee; the inviting professor is responsible for identifying funding for it and under no circumstances can they ask you to cover or reimburse them for it. If you are unfamiliar with Concordia, the following list of academic units and departments and website for exploring research at Concordia is a good starting point for identifying Concordia professors whose fields of expertise correspond to yours. Please be advised, however, that Concordia professors are not obliged to host academic visitors and Concordia International cannot find a professor to invite you to campus for you. In order for a professor to invite you to campus, she or he will need the following information from you.  We advise that you supply this information to the professor at least six (6) months before your expected arrival date in Canada.   Section 1 of the Academic Visitor Request Form completed. A letter from your home institution indication your affiliation/status there. A copy of your curriculum vitae. A photocopy of your passport page showing personal information (photo, name, date of birth, etc.) if you are not a Canadian citizen or other similar identification document if you are Canadian. If you are a Canadian permanent resident, please also include a copy of your valid permanent resident card.  If you already hold an open temporary work permit authorizing you to work anywhere in Canada for the duration of your visit, please include a copy of the same. If the request is approved by the University, you will receive an official Letter of Invitation (LOI), an Acceptance Form and, where applicable, CIC immigration documents for you to apply for a Temporary Work Permit. Sign and return the Acceptance Form as instructed on and use the other document to begin applying for a Temporary Work Permit. Please don’t apply for a visa or work permit until such time that Concordia provides you with the required documentation. Pre-departure information Immigration: If you are not a Canadian citizen, permanent resident or do not hold an open work permit for the duration of your visit, then you are responsible for obtaining any and all immigration documents required for you to enter Canada and conduct your research project at Concordia. Immigration options to foreign Academic Visitors include: Work Permit Exemptions: 120-day work permit exemption for researchers. For further details, please visit http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/researcher-exemption.asp; 15/30-day work permit exemption for highly skilled workers. For further details, please visit http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/short-term-exemption.asp; Self-funding researcher may be eligible to work without obtaining a work permit if they meet the criteria for the business visitor category: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/permit/business/index.asp. The Business Visitors category also includes foreign professors and researchers seeking entry to Canada to evaluate academic university programs or research proposals as well as Seminar Leaders or Guest Speakers provided the seminar does not last more than five (5) days. Work Permits: according to current regulations, most academic visitors are required to obtain a Temporary Work Permit regardless of whether or not you receive any compensation in Canada. Temporary Work Permits may be based on Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) or Exempted exempt from LMIA requirement. Please be advised that Concordia will not apply for an LMIA for any academic visitor should you not qualify for an exemption. There are several relevant LMIA exemptions for Academic Visitors, including:   Exemption C20: “Canadian interests - Reciprocal employment general”. Your home institution must have an existing reciprocal, bilateral exchange agreement with Concordia. For a list of current Concordia bilateral partners, please consult: http://www.concordia.ca/international/partnerships.html; Exemption C21: International Experience Canada for the citizens of certain countries Canada has an agreement with. Please verify if you’re eligible to apply here: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/iec/eligibility.asp; Exemption C22: Reciprocal employment – Academic exchanges designed mainly for Guest Lecturers and Visiting Professors: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/opinion/academic.asp;  http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/opinion/policy.asp; Exemption T23: NAFTA Professionals allows US and Mexican Research assistants and Professors to obtain a work permit exempted from the LMIA requirement; International Non-Trade Agreements [R204(a) – T11], such as Fulbright Program between Canada and the U.S., Scientific and Technical Cooperation Agreement between Canada and Germany, etc.; Other International Mobility Programs (i.e. Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement; International Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) - Canada-Peru, Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, etc.). You are responsible for informing yourself of CIC requirements for applying for any travel documents you might need.  Insurance: CIC will require you to obtain a Canadian health insurance policy for the duration of your stay in Canada. Health insurance policies vary in coverage and price, but the insurance you choose should cover at least 80% of any medical treatment you receive. You should also take any personal health condition in consideration when selecting a policy. In addition to health insurance, you are also responsible for making sure make sure you have appropriate travel, repatriation, emergency medical evacuation, liability and any other type of insurance you may deem necessary.  Many companies sell insurance policies in Québec. You are encouraged to do as much research as you can, but here are a few to help get you started: Blue Cross Student Guard Desjardins RBC Make an appointment with your supervising professor: Once you know when you will be arriving, you should contact your supervising professor to schedule an appointment to meet her or him, visit the location where you will be conducting your research internship and coordinate any other remaining details. Arrival information Finding Accommodations in Montreal:  Academic visitors to Concordia are responsible for securing their own accommodations while here.  If you are coming during the summer months, you may request on-campus accommodations, for more information please contact Summer accomodations. Throughout the rest of the year, you will have to search and secure your own apartment or other accommodations.  Luckily, finding accommodations in Montreal is relatively easy and inexpensive when compared to other major North American cities. To get started on finding out how to search for an apartment in Montreal, please visit Concordia’s page on off-campus housing. Your status at Concordia: As an academic visitor at Concordia, you will be considered as a visitor. You will not be able to register for courses at Concordia as an academic visitor and will not have access to the same types of services offered to registered, tuition-paying Concordia students will not be eligible for reduced fares on the subway and bus systems. University Identification: As soon as you arrive, you should obtain a Concordia University I.D. It will give you access to certain parts of the campus that require it, such as the library and the shuttle bus. To obtain an I.D., please take your Letter of Invitation, Passport, Work Permit and address in Montreal to Human Resources (SGW FB-1130/1250, rue Guy) between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday through Friday.

Academic advisors are here to help you progress through your degree at Concordia. (Graduate advising information varies depending on program. For an overview of academic advising and suggested contacts by program see Step 1 — Advising under the Graduate tab in the Registration guide.) Academic advising (for undergraduates) Tips for registration (for undergraduates) Advising structure for undergraduate students Your main advisor’s contact information is in your Student Centre. Depending on your program, you may have access to additional advisors who can answer your questions and assist with academic planning:   Faculty level Each Faculty has a Student Academic Services (SAS) or Services for Undergraduate Student Affairs office staffed with full-time professional advisors. These advisors can help with: General degree requirements (i.e. BA, BAdmin, BEng) Elective courses Transfer credits Faculty-wide regulations Student requests (exceptions to academic regulations) Internal degree transfers and changes in concentration Study abroad opportunities Academic options for students facing extenuating circumstances Department level Departmental advisors may be faculty members or administrative staff. They can help with: Course selection and registration Course sequence Program and degree requirements Program level In some cases, program advisors are also available. Advisors may be faculty members or administrative staff and can help with: Advising for a specific academic program offered by a department Course selection and registration Course sequence Program and degree requirements Independent students Depending on the program you would like to enter, the advisor you should contact may vary.  Refer to the Independent Students website for more information. What you must do before meeting with your advisor New students Review your Offer of Admission email carefully. Read your Advising and Registration email (which you will receive after confirming your offer of admission) carefully. Explore the Welcome Guide for New Concordians thoroughly. All students Consult your faculty’s advising website (list below) for the next steps specific to your situation. Each Faculty, School and/or department has its own advising policies and procedures, so your next steps may be different from your friends’. Read about your program and its requirements in the Undergraduate Calendar to learn more about the courses you are required to complete in order to earn your degree. Visit your department’s website, to see if a degree planning or course sequencing worksheet is available for your program, and if so, fill it out to the best of your ability before your advising appointment. Write down any questions you would like to ask your advisor in advance. For example: How is my GPA calculated? Will this course count towards my program? How do I change programs? How do I take a course in another Faculty/School? What semester can I graduate in? Remember - Academic advice is unique to you! Academic advice ​can vary - even for students in the same program or faculty. Keep in mind that your classmates have individual circumstances that impacts the academic advice they receive so it is strongly recommended that you connect with your academic advisor to get personalized answers to your questions. Contact your program advisor!

As such, we must share roadways through mutual collaboration and courtesy. Here are a few tips for sharing the road safely   Signal your intentions Cyclists must clearly indicate the direction they want to take or maneuver they are planning. Bus drivers can then anticipate their movements and prepare accordingly.    Stop at bus stops and stay behind the bus When a bus is at a stop or red light, cyclists must stay behind it and not pass on either the left or the right. If a cyclist is next to a bus at a red light, he or she must position themselves to be clearly seen by the bus driver. When the light turns green, it is more prudent to let the bus go first. That way, cyclists can avoid close encounters in tight spaces. Cyclists should never overtake a bus from the right (sidewalk side), as the bus can stop at any time to let passengers on or off. This will help prevent accidents.   Make eye contact When overtaking or crossing paths, it is crucial that cyclists make eye contact with the bus driver to ensure they were clearly seen. Buses have blind spots at the front, the rear and on both sides. Bus drivers cannot see everything, everywhere, all at once. Therefore, it is important that cyclists stay at a safe distance from the bus to remain visible at all time and to avoid finding themselves in a blind spot.   Pay attention to pedestrians who must cross the bicycle path to catch their bus In some specific locations, pedestrians must cross the bicycle path to reach their bus stop. For everyone’s safety, please comply with the following guidelines: Pedestrian crossings are identified by wide yellow road markings, giving pedestrians priority over cyclists. It is recommended that cyclists slow down or even come to a full stop to yield to pedestrians. It is important to indicate your presence to make sure pedestrians clearly see you.   Stay to the right Cyclists must stay as close as possible to the curb or right-hand side of the road and always travel in the same direction as traffic, while watching out for potholes and opening car doors.   Do not ride your bike in bus loops and terminuses For reasons of safety, cyclists should walk next to their bicycle around bus loops and terminuses. They should never be riding their bicycle in areas where passengers transfer between buses.

Do not confuse the dates you see in the examples in this guide with the actual current term dates and information. Step 1 — Academic advising Academic advising The requirements for advising prior to registration vary according to your program of study. To determine if you require advising refer to the Holds box on your Student Center page or go to your Faculty or School’s advising information page by clicking on the appropriate link below. How to contact your academic advisor: In most cases, you will be assigned an academic advisor for your main plan of study and potentially for any additional plans that you may have. You can easily see the advisor information from the homepage of your student centre: This displays the name of your individual advisor or advising team along with their contact telephone number (if available). If you click on the “details” link, you will see a breakdown of which advisor or advising team relates to each of your plans. If available, and depending on the email program you are using, you can click on the link where the name of the advisor or advising team is shown. This will allow you to email your advisor. If there is no link, then no email address has been provided and you should use the contact phone number to reach your advisor. NOTE: If you are using an internet email client such as Gmail, you can hover the cursor over the link and the email address will be displayed in the bottom left of your screen. Alternatively, depending on the browser you are using, you can right-click on the link and select ‘copy email address’. You may then paste the address into your email client. You can also get more information about advising from the links below:    »  Arts and Science    »  John Molson School of Business    »  Engineering and Computer Science    »  Fine Arts    »  Independent students Step 2 — Accessing registration Register for courses. You can also find the link to register on to the Student Hub's My CU Account page. If you are on a mobile device or a tablet, click the Enroll tile to begin your registration process. If you are using a desktop, you can access the enrolment functions from the left-hand navigation Enrollment dropdown or by clicking on Enroll on the right. Step 3 — Plan your timetable To assist you in planning your timetable we have included information on how to look for courses three different ways: A – Use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder The Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule. B – Use the Class Search You can search for a range of classes based on specific criteria you can define. C – Browse the Course Catalog This is a comprehensive listing of courses offered at Concordia University. Please note the following: Test Results If you plan on registering for English Composition or ESL (English as a Second Language) courses and have written the appropriate placement test, your results will be sent to you by e-mail. REQUISITES Pre-requisites – These are usually either specific classes you must have taken or a minimum amount of credits that you will need to have obtained before you can register for a given class. Co-requisites – These are classes that need to be taken at the same time (or previously) in order to be able to register for a given class. Anti-requisites – These are other classes for which you must not have previously received credit (including any transfer credit or exemptions) in order to be eligible to register for a given class. For example, MARK495 is an anti-requisite of MARK301. To register for MARK301, students should not have previously taken and received credit for MARK495. The reason for these types of requirements are to stop students taking courses out of sequence or taking a higher level course and then trying to take a lower level course that may have similar content. You should consult the Undergraduate Calendar to see the requisites for the course in which you want to register. If you receive a message about ‘requisites not met’ when trying to register for a class, you should ensure that you have met all of the requisites as stated in the Undergraduate Calendar. If you believe that you have then you will need to speak to your department (JMSB students, please contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office) so that they can look into this matter for you. Degree students: You are not permitted to register for a course that has a prerequisite if you have not completed that prerequisite. If you have received authorization from an academic advisor to register for a course without the stated prerequisite, the advisor must enter a waiver that will permit you access to the course. Independent/Visiting students: If you wish to register for courses where the prerequisite was completed elsewhere, you must complete a “Prerequisite Waiver Form” and receive approval prior to registering. Note that you must include specific details of the course, including the course name and number, where and when it was completed, as well as the course description and transcripts. This form is available at the Birks Student Service Centre.   RESERVE SEATS IN CLASSES Some classes have seats that are reserved for students in specific programs. This is usually done to ensure that students who need the class as part of their program are able to register for it. Depending on the rules defined by the department that offers the class, they may set all, some, or none of the seats to be reserved.  If you try to register for a class and receive a message about ‘reserved seats’ then you should select another class or consult the department or the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office, for JMSB students to obtain permission to take the class. DEPARTMENT CONSENT Some classes may require that you first obtain permission to take the class. If you receive a message that states: “Department Consent Required”, you will need to speak to the department that offers the class in order to obtain permission to register. JMSB students will need to contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office.          A — Use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder The Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule. Note that the tool does not register you for any courses but will allow you to add courses directly to your enrollment course cart. You will then need to follow the instructions further down this page in Step 6A – Adding Classes. You can access the Concordia Class Schedule Builder from four different places in your student centre: 1. Student Centre Homepage Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Click the “class schedule builder” link shown in the image below. 2. Class Search Page Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Click the “SEARCH FOR CLASSES” button on the top right of the page. On the Search for Classes page, click the “SEARCH WITH CLASS SCHEDULE BUILDER” button. 3. Enrollment Course Cart page Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Then either click the ‘Enroll’ or ‘enrollment course cart’ links. Then on the next page select the relevant term and click CONTINUE. Once in the enrollment course cart, select the ‘Class Schedule Builder’ option (shown below) and click ‘search’. 4. Class Schedule Page Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre.  Select the ‘Class Schedule’ option from the drop-down list in the Academics section.  Then on the next page select the relevant term and click CONTINUE. On the ‘My Class Schedule’ page, select the ‘View in Class Schedule Builder’ option at the top right. For more information about how to use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder, please watch the instructional video available on the Student Hub.          B — Use the class search The Search for classes function is used to look for information about scheduled classes for a particular term and is generally available in early March. A variety of search criteria may be entered to narrow or broaden a search. Search results provide information such as date and time of classes, location, name of instructor, number of seats available and so on. To search for classes: Select the desired term from the drop-down menu. Term Selection Example: For a Summer class, select “Summer 2021” For a Fall class, select “Fall 2021” For a Winter class, select “Winter 2022” For a Fall / Winter class, select “Fall/Winter 2021-22” (6 credit FULL YEAR classes only) To view classes in all terms of the academic year, select “ALL TERMS (2021-2022) NOTE: Any terms in the list that end in “(CCE Only)” will only return results for Continuing Education classes. Enter search criteria into open fields: Conduct a basic search by entering information into the fields displayed under Class Search Criteria (see Basic Search Criteria table below for more information), or Conduct an advanced search by clicking the Additional Search Criteria fields (see Advanced Search Criteria table below for more information). NOTE: You must enter or select a minimum of two search criteria (in addition to the term selection).   Use the CLEAR button to clear information from the fields and enter new search criteria. Click the SEARCH button to retrieve results. View information returned on the Search Results page: If you are searching in a term in which you have already enrolled, your “My Class Schedule” will be displayed. A summary of the search criteria entered List of classes that meet the search criteria, including class details, class name and number, section, location, days, times, instructor, term offered, availability, and status. New search criteria can be entered by clicking the NEW SEARCH or MODIFY SEARCH button If a class in the search results is offered in a career and term that you are active in, then you will be able to use the “select” button next to the class to add it to your Course Cart. For example, if you are in an undergraduate program but search for a graduate class, the select button will not appear. If you are already enrolled in a class or a class is already in your enrollment course cart, the “select” button will not appear.   BASIC SEARCH CRITERIA Term The “Term” drop down refers to the term for which you are searching for class(es). Course Career The “Course Career” drop-down menu allows you to select if you want to search for classes offered to Undergraduates, Graduates, Professional Development (GradProSkills), Research, or classes in Continuing Education. Select Subject The green “select subject” button provides an alphabetical listing of all class subjects that have been offered historically (these may not currently be offered). If you already know the abbreviation of the Class Subject, type it into the blank field beside the “select subject” button. For example, type “ENGL” for English classes, or “FINA” for Finance classes. Course Number The “Course Number” field narrows the search down further to a specific class. For example, if you want to search for the POLI 202 class, you would enter “POLI” in the ‘Select Subject’ field above and then enter “202” into the ‘Course Number’ field. Course Level The “Course Level” field allows you to search for classes at a specific level. You can select multiple levels if you wish to view a larger range of results. For example, if you want to view all 200-level classes, select the “200” checkbox. If you want to view all 500 and 600-level classes, select both the “500” and “600” checkboxes. NOTE: The Course Level option can only be used for credit courses. This can be combined with the ‘Select subject’ field or the ‘Department or Faculty’ field to refine results. Department or Faculty The “Department or Faculty” field allows you to search for classes offered by a specific department or faculty. For example, to search for classes offered by the Education department, select “Education” from the drop-down menu. To search for classes offered by the Fine Arts faculty, select “FACULTY OF FINE ARTS” from the drop-down menu. NOTE: When searching for classes offered by a Faculty, you may have to refine your search by selecting additional criteria. . ADDITIONAL SEARCH CRITERIA Class Times The “Class Times” field refers to the class start and end times. Entering a time in the first field will search for all classes starting after the time entered. Entering a time in the second field will search for all classes ending before the time entered. These fields can be used together to search for classes within a desired range. NOTE: The times should be entered in a 24-hour format. For example, if you wish to search for 7am, enter “07.00”, or for 7pm, enter “19.00”. Days of the week You can select any of the checkboxes next to the relevant day(s) of the week to include classes offered on that day in the search. NOTE: If you select a specific day, the search results will include classes that are scheduled on that day, including any classes that are split between the selected day and another day. For example, if you select the “Mon” checkbox only, you will see classes scheduled on a Monday only and classes scheduled on a Monday and Wednesday. Location You can use the “Location” field to search for any combination of ‘in-person’ classes scheduled at the ‘Sir George Williams (Downtown)’ or ‘Loyola’ campuses, or for ‘Online Courses. NOTE: If you search only for Online classes, then any Class Times entered or Days of Week selected will be ignored. Instructor Last Name Search for classes taught by a specific instructor by entering the first few letters, the exact last name, or letters contained in the name. Course Keyword Search for a class by its title and description. Enter a full or partial keyword to return search results that include all classes with the keyword or partial keyword as part of the title or description. Class Nbr Enter the ‘Class Nbr’ if known. This is a 4 or 5-digit class number that a class is assigned in the Student Information System. NOTE: This is not the same number as the “Course Number” field above. Mode of Instruction There are three modes of instruction at Concordia: In Person – In Person courses are taught in-person on a Concordia campus. On-Line – On-line courses are taught online and not in a classroom setting. Blended Learning – Blended Learning courses are a combination of in-class and online learning. Class times, locations and specific dates listed in Days/Times and Start/End Date fields will indicate which in-class meetings are required. For more information, please see the notes tab or contact the department.          C — Browse course catalog The Browse Course Catalog feature provides access to a comprehensive listing of information about courses offered at Concordia University.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Search > Browse Course Catalog To browse for courses: Course List provides the opportunity to look for a particular course subject by selecting the first letter of the subject of the course: Selecting a letter brings up a list of matching course subjects. Selecting a particular course subject will display a list of courses available. Important Note:  the existence of a course on this list does not guarantee that the course is currently offered. If you click on the “Course Nbr” or “Course Title” column you will be able to see the course details: The Course Detail page will identify whether or not the course has been scheduled. If it is scheduled, you will be able to “view class sections” to learn how many sections are available and when they are offered. If a course does not have a description, please refer to the undergraduate academic calendar for further details regarding the course. Selecting the View Class Sections link displays the term in which you are considering taking the course and you can see whether or not it is being offered. Step 4 — Enrollment appointment dates The enrollment appointment date is the first date on which you may begin the registration process for that term. Your individual date will be displayed in the Enrollment Dates box on your Student Center page. Example: Although the enrollment appointment dates indicate when you will be able to start registering, you can start planning and filling your Course Cart in early March.  The enrollment appointment date is based on the number of credits to completion for your program if you are a degree student. If you wish to calculate your enrollment appointment date, the following formula is used: Program length (minimum credits required) minus credits earned minus in progress courses as of February 2019 (excluding DISC courses) equals credits to completion. Following are all the enrollment appointment dates for 2021-22: Enrollment appointment dates Summer 2021 (term number 2211) Fall 2021 (term number 2212) Fall/Winter 2021 - 22 (term number 2213) Winter 2022 (term number 2214)   Enrollment Appointment Date Credits to completion or category of student March 9 0 to 9 credits + COOP Students, Varsity Students March 10 10 to 21 credits March 11 22 to 33 credits March 12 34 to 42 credits March 15 43 to 54 credits March 16 55 to 63 credits March 17 64 to 72 credits March 18 73 to 87 credits March 19 88 and more credits March 22 Visiting undergraduate students, returning and newly authorized undergraduate Independent students for Summer 2021 (term number 2211) April 20 Visiting Students – for Fall / Winter April 20 Newly admitted undergraduate students registering for Fall 2021 (term number 2212), Fall/Winter 2021-22 (term number 2213) and Winter 2022 (term number 2214) terms Students admitted for Fall 2021 (term number 2212) should register for Fall 2021 (term number 2212) and Winter 2022 (term number 2214) courses at the same time. August 2 Returning and newly authorized undergraduate Independent students for Fall 2021 (term number 2212). September 21 New undergraduate students admitted for Winter 2022 (term number 2214) can register any time after admission and advising criteria have been satisfied November 25 Newly authorized undergraduate Independent students for Winter 2022 (term number 2214) Step 5 — System availability On the enrollment appointment dates, the system is programmed to be available from 8 a.m. onward. The registration system may be extremely busy at 8 a.m. on each new enrollment appointment date. Step 6 — Registration While departmental and faculty advisors and staff are always available to give advice and guidance, you are responsible for the completeness and correctness of your course selection and registration, and for observing the University’s regulations and deadlines.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > My Academics If the information concerning your program is incorrect you may contact 514-848-2424, ext. 2668 to find out how to make corrections. It is important for this information to be correct, as the wrong degree or concentration may block you from entering courses for which you are eligible. Address Verification – On the Student Center page, you will see your current address. If you need to correct your address or any other piece of personal information, click on the relevant area under the Personal Information banner and you will be redirected to another screen where you can make the necessary changes. Please note that you are responsible for providing the University with your current mailing and e-mail address. You are required to fulfill all financial and administrative obligations within the prescribed deadlines regardless of the validity of your address in our files. Student Hub > Get to know your self-service portal          A — Adding classes You can add classes to your schedule for the selected term in three easy steps with a couple of restrictions to note: If you have a financial hold you will not be able to register in classes until you clear the hold. Classes can only be added until the add/drop deadline for a given term. For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Add Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection. Click the Continue button.   Find a class to add, using one of the options displayed, or, if you know the class number, enter it into the Enter Class Nbr field Class Schedule Builder – refer to Step 3 A – Use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder above if you need further help. Class Search – refer to Step 3 B – Use the Class Search above if you need further help. To view details of the course, click on the Section to obtain further information about the course. If satisfied that you wish to enroll in this course, choose “select”. Confirm the class information. If the section selected also requires you to register for additional components such as labs, tutorials, conferences, etc. you will be required to make that choice before proceeding further: Once you have selected the conference, press Next.  You will receive confirmation that the course has been added to your Course Cart. NOTE: Having a course added to your Course Cart does not mean that you are registered in the course. You must click on ‘Proceed to Step 2 of 3’ OR  ‘enroll’ in order to go to the final confirmation page. At this point, you may continue to add further courses to your Course Cart. Once you have added all your required courses, you will need to click on the “Proceed To Step 2 of 3” button. If your registration was successful you will see the following message: If it was unsuccessful you will receive an error explaining what the problem is and what you must do to rectify the situation. Here is just one possible example: For Example, the above message is informing you that Departmental Consent is required before you can register in this course. It would be necessary for you to contact the relevant Department to obtain the necessary consent. In other instances, you may be denied registration in a course that appears to have seats available. This is caused by the Department/Faculty having reserved seats for students in a particular department or program of study. Remember to register for all terms Summer (2191), Fall (2192), Fall/Winter (2193) and Winter (2194) at the same time – do not wait until later in the Fall to register for your Winter courses as you may find them filled to capacity.          B — Dropping classes Please note: If you only want to change sections of the same course see Step 6, C – Swapping classes. There are three easy steps to dropping a class from your schedule but there are two different types of course withdrawals and both are controlled by deadline dates shown in the Term Dates and Deadlines. Please note the following important details: DNE – did not enter – The DNE date is generally one to two weeks after the first day of classes. A withdrawal (drop) before the DNE deadline date is treated as if you were never in the course. There will be no entry on your student record for that course and you will not be charged tuition and other fees for that course. If you have already paid for the course, you will receive financial credit for course fees. DISC – discontinue – The DISC date is later in the term. A withdrawal (drop) after the DNE date, but before the DISC deadline date allows you to stop attending that course with no academic penalty. Unlike the DNE, however, the course will remain on your student record with an entry of DISC and you will be held financially responsible for the payment of 100% of tuition and other fees, including the Winter portion of a full-year course. Not attending classes, or informing an instructor of an intent to withdraw, does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does it entitle a student to a refund of fees or cancellation of registration. Without formally dropping the course by the appropriate academic withdrawal deadline, non-attendance of a class will result in the assignment of a failing grade. If you enroll in a fall term course that is a prerequisite for a winter course and later drop the fall course, the Faculty/Department involved will run a process at the beginning of the winter term to ensure that all students registered in a course with prerequisites have successfully completed that prerequisite. Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed, you will not have the option to select that term. If you have a financial hold, you will be able to drop classes, but you will not be able to add classes. If you intend to replace a dropped class with a new class, ensure that all financial holds are cleared. For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Drop NOTE: If you receive an error message stating “You are not authorized for self service enrollment at this time” when you click on the Drop tab, you will need to click the “change term” button and then follow the steps below. Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table. Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection from the table. Click the Continue button. All registered classes for the term will be displayed in a grid. Multi-component classes will display all registered sections. Select the class(es) you want to drop and click the Drop Selected Classes button. Note that you are able to drop multiple courses at once if you wish to do so. Select the My class Schedule button to retrieve your class schedule and confirm that the class(es) are no longer shown OR if they are, that they correctly show the status as Dropped or DSC.          C — Swapping classes (including Section changes) You can swap one course for another or one section for a different one. The process is a combination of add and drop. The swap function allows you to verify the availability of another course or section of the same course before you make a decision. There is, therefore, no risk of losing the section you have if another section is not available.  DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, use the drop and add features to accomplish a section change. If you drop the section that you are currently registered for and then find out that no spaces are available in other sections, you may not be able to get back into the section you were originally registered in as another student may have taken your place once you dropped the course. There are some restrictions attached to swapping classes: If you have a financial hold you will not be able to swap any classes until you clear the hold. Classes can only be swapped until the add/drop deadline for a given term.  For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page. If you are not enrolled in any classes you will not have access to swap classes. The swap feature should not be used to swap between summer classes in different summer sessions. For example, do not use it to swap from a May to June course into a June to August course or from a full summer (May to August) course into either a May to June course or a June to August course. To swap a component of a multi-component class while keeping one or more of the other components (for example, swap HIST 202 Lec A, Conf AA for HIST 202 Lec A, Conf BB while keeping the same lecture) see the section entitled Swapping Multi-Component Classes.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Swap Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table. Click the Continue button. The first grid on this page called, Swap This Class, displays a list of classes in which you are currently enrolled. The next section, called With This Class, allows you to search for a class using the class search feature, or to select from your Course Cart, or to enter the Class Nbr if you already know it. Select the class that you wish to swap from with the Swap This Class grid. Select the class that you want to swap to using the With This class grid. If you use the search feature and identify a course, you will be asked to choose the section you want by using the “select class” button and you are then re-directed to the Confirm your selection page. If you Select from your Course Cart, using the select button next to that option takes you to the Confirm your selection page. If you use the Enter Class Nrb feature and press enter you will eventually reach the Confirm your selection page. Confirm your selection and click the Finish Swapping button. If the swap is unsuccessful either follow the instructions in the error message or try another course by selecting SWAP from the menu bar: View My Class Schedule to verify the status of your swap transaction: Swapping multi-component classes (while keeping one or more of the other components) Search for the class using the search function in the With this class grid. You will be prompted to make a selection for all required components even if you want to keep the same sections in which you are already enrolled. Confirm your selection. All related components of a class will be displayed. Verify the swap transaction. View My Class Schedule to ensure that the class has been swapped in your registration. PLEASE NOTE – If you try to swap one of your components for another one that is currently on a waitlist, then you will be placed on the waitlist for ALL components of the class and potentially lose your place in the class. If you do not want to take this risk, then do not use the swap feature to swap components if your preferred component is on a waitlist. For example: You are currently enrolled in COMP248 Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X. You want to stay in Lecture U and Laboratory UI-X, but swap the tutorial for U UB (which is on a waitlist). If you attempt to do this using a swap, you will lose your existing places in Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X and be placed on the waitlist for Lecture U, Tutorial U UB and Laboratory UI-X.          D — Wait listing classes Once all seats in a course have been filled it may still be possible for you to add your name to a wait list. Academic departments have the choice of offering wait list seats or not. To determine which courses will allow you to add your name to a wait list:    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Search Select the term Select the subject Select the course number Search Once the results of the search are displayed, click on the Section hyperlink: You are now on the Class Detail page which indicates whether or not a Wait List is available for the course selected and it is also indicated what the wait list capacity is for the course and the Wait List total. This tells you that 80 students can add their name to a wait list after the class capacity of 770 has been reached. There are two scenarios under which you may add your name to a wait list. You have not yet enrolled in your maximum course load so that if a seat becomes available you would be eligible to add it to your other courses for that term. You have enrolled in your maximum course load but you set-up your name on a wait list using the swap feature so that if a seat does become available, you would swap one course for another. Scenario 1 You start the registration process by trying to register for ECON 201 but the course is full and you get the following error message: You use the class search described above to see the detail of the course and determine that a wait list is available and that there is still room for you to add your name. Knowing this, you select the course again and tick the box labelled Wait list if class is full and select next. You will see the resulting message: If a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be registered automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty. Scenario 2 If you are permitted to enroll in 15 credits in the fall term and you have already reached that capacity but still want the possibility of entering INTE 123, you would use the Swap This Class grid to identify which of your courses you would swap. You would then go to the With This Class grid and enter the course. You will then follow the normal steps to get to the point where you identify that you want to “Wait list if class is full”. If a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be swapped from one course to the other automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty. Some tips about wait lists You can wait list for a maximum of 6 units per term. You cannot be wait listed for two sections of the same course. You can remove your name from a wait list by using the drop feature. Note: Adding your name to a waitlist does NOT guarantee that you will get into the class. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are on a waitlist for a course, it does not mean that you are actually registered for the course. You will only be registered into the course if a seat becomes available and the system registers you into the class based on your waitlist position. Step 7 — Verify your courses You can verify your schedule in two different formats. From your Student Center page you can choose weekly schedule. The resulting “My Class Schedule” page allows you to select the term for which you wish to verify your registrations. After selecting the term, press continue. You then have the choice of seeing your schedule in a list view or a weekly calendar view. The list view is as follows: The weekly calendar view is as follows: PLEASE NOTE: The weekly calendar view of your class schedule will not show any classes that occur on a national or university holiday. Any online classes that you are enrolled in will appear at the bottom of the calendar.   The Concordia Class Schedule Builder view is as below: Once you have selected the term in the Concordia Class Schedule Builder, you will see the classes that you are enrolled in, are on the waitlist for, or have in your enrollment course cart. Step 8 — How to obtain help If you encounter faculty-related difficulties (prerequisites, co-requisites, anti-requisites; permission of the department required; closed class, etc.) while using the Registration system, you must contact your department. Please refer to the following links:    »  Arts and Science    »  John Molson School of Business    »  Engineering and Computer Science    »  Fine Arts For non Faculty-related problems, please call 514-848-2424, ext. 2668 Monday to Friday, from 09:00 – 17:00, all year round, except for holidays. Should you experience technical difficulties, please contact the Concordia Service Desk at: By phone: 514-848-2424, ext. 7613 Via email at: help@concordia.ca By opening a ticket Please note that the Service Desk cannot assist you directly with any issues you are having registering for classes. You should contact your advisor or department or, for JMSB students, the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office initially and they will then contact the Service Desk on your behalf if it is an issue they are unable to resolve. Step 9 — Obtain your account balance and verify payment deadlines Information regarding your account balance is available from the Student Center page under the Finances banner: Payment Deadlines: Due Now – this is the amount that you owe for the tuition and fees for the current term. An amount may show as ‘Due now’ before the final payment deadline. For example, the tuition fees for a Fall term are generally due at the beginning of September but you are allowed until the end of September to pay them without financial penalty. These fees will show as ‘Due Now’ in your Student Centre from the beginning of September. Future Due – this is the amount that you will have to pay for the upcoming term(s), including tuition and fees for classes you have enrolled in for any upcoming term(s). For example, if you are enrolling in Winter classes before the beginning of January, the tuition fees for these classes will show as ‘Future Due’ in your Student Centre until the beginning of January.   PLEASE NOTE – if you have recently enrolled or dropped some classes and you would like to see your updated tuition balance, you can click on the “Account Inquiry” link in the top-left of the Finances section.  This will trigger a recalculation of your tuition fees and update your balance accordingly.

This page explains when you may apply for a deferred exam and how to do it. Deferral applications are only applicable to undergraduate exams that were administered by the exams office. Be sure to review all the university regulations concerning DEF notations in the undergraduate calendar. Read regulations concerning DEF notations What does a DEF notation mean? A DEF notation on your transcript indicates that you missed a final examination and have permission to write a deferred exam at a future date. After you write the deferred final exam your final grade in the course will replace the DEF notation on your transcript.  Eligibility for DEF notations NOTE: Requests for deferred examinations can be made in a maximum of three (3) exam sessions during a student’s undergraduate or Independent studies at Concordia. You may apply for a DEF notation if you missed a final exam due to unforeseeable circumstances beyond your control. Unforeseeable and/or extraordinary circumstances may include: a serious illness or severe injury a recent death in one’s immediate family unexpectedly assuming responsibility of an immediate family member due to serious illness religious conflict (where alternate exam does not meet the needs) not having a private space within which to write an online examination responsible for children or other dependents who cannot be left unattended during exam lost connectivity or encountered technical difficulty during online exam (without completion of the exam) Check your transcript when you apply for a DEF notation. If you missed your final exam your grade must be accompanied by a DNW (Did Not Write) notation. We cannot process if you receive one of the following grades: R NR If you believe you have received a failing grade in error, you must discuss your situation with the instructor. How to apply for a deferral Be aware that requests for deferred exams can be made in a maximum of three (3) exam sessions during your undergraduate or independent studies at Concordia.

Future students Student hub Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search News Concordia researchers develop a tool to neutralize chemical weapons using rare-earth elements A new kind of metal–organic framework created in the Howarth Lab can rapidly break down sulfur mustard November 3, 2021 | By 		Patrick Lejtenyi Tb-CU-10 metal organic framework. Image: Victor Quezada-Novoa Researchers at Concordia are studying the potential applications of a type of compound called metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). They have designed a new kind of microscopic structure that can rapidly mitigate chemical weapons when exposed to ultraviolet light. MOFs are artificially created hybrid networks of metal clusters bound to each other by organic linkers called ligands. They are usually open-faced and porous, sometimes described as sponge-like. They are extremely versatile, depending on the kinds of materials involved, and they can be used in a wide variety of applications from water remediation to drug delivery. One such MOF is the topic of a new paper by PhD candidate Victor Quezada-Novoa and Ashlee Howarth, an assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry and Concordia University Research Chair in Metal-Organic Frameworks in the Faculty of Arts and Science. In it they report on the design and synthesis of a new MOF composed of the rare-earth metals yttrium and terbium, bound with an organic linker. They named the structure RE-CU-10 (RE = rare-earth, CU = Concordia University). The researchers published their findings in the journal Chemistry of Materials. Hatem Titi of McGill University and Amy Sarjeant at Bristol Myers Squibb co-authored the paper. Ashlee Howarth and Victor Quezada-Novoa: “We hope one day to test this metal–organic framework in a military laboratory setting.” Fast-acting oxygen species Lead author Quezada-Novoa says the linker, a rectangular tetratopic pyrene-based ligand, has a particular core that interacts with ultraviolet light, producing an exceptionally reactive, though short-lived, oxygen species that causes a change in the chemical warfare agent sulfur mustard. It’s better known as the infamous World War I blistering agent mustard gas and is still stockpiled and in use today. Working at the Howarth Lab at Concordia, Quezada-Novoa suspended his MOF in a small glass vial containing a millilitre of methanol. After adding 23 microlitres of the sulfur mustard simulant and exposing the vial to a UV LED photoreactor, the researchers found that the MOF effectively oxidized — and thereby detoxified — the chemical warfare agent simulant. The process took about 15 minutes, achieving 50 per cent conversion to the less toxic product in only three and a half minutes. “We demonstrated that the material we synthesized works very quickly and is in fact one of the fastest catalytic materials to be reported using this reaction setup,” Quezada-Novoa says. “It has the potential to be scaled up and we hope one day to test this MOF in a military laboratory setting. That is our goal, given that there remain thousands of litres of stockpiled sulfur mustard around the world.” Howarth points out that Quezada-Novoa’s work is distinct from other research into MOFs because it relies on rare-earth metals, elements found worldwide including in northern Canada, that have vital industrial uses, from smart phones to missile guidance systems. “Researchers have looked at using MOFs to neutralize chemical weapons before, but they have never used rare-earth MOFs with multinuclear cluster nodes,” Howarth explains. “Victor developed a brand-new material with specific features that are different from any of the MOFs used before.” Adaptable to many needs Metal-organic frameworks and their various applications are the general research theme at the Howarth Lab. “Every student in the group is targeting a different end goal,” she says. “And while they are exploring different directions in their research, they are all working on these molecular structures that we can tune and design into almost any type of chemistry we want depending on the final application.” This study was made possible with support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Guidelines Submitting application and documents Once you have all your documentation together and you are ready to apply: Submit the ""Quebec Residency Application"" and supporting documents at MyConcordia. Log into MyConcordia.ca On the left-hand side, under ""MyConcordia Menu,"" choose ""My Student Centre."" Under the ""Personal Information"" section, select ""Quebec Residency Application.""  Supporting documents can also be submitted to the Birks Student Service Centre (LB-185). *If you have problems with the online submissions, you can also send your applications by: By Fax: 514-848-2621 In-Person: Birks Student Service Centre 1400 De Maisonneuve Blvd. West, Room LB-185 By Mail or Courier: Concordia University Office of the Registrar, FB 900 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. Montreal, Quebec Canada H3G 1M8 Contact phone number for courier: 514-848-2424 Renewing of your Quebec Residency status Once approved, students who are considered permanent Quebec residents never have to renew their Quebec residency status. You are considered a permanent resident if you are: Born in Quebec Holder of a CSQ (certificat de sélection du Quebec) Adopted by a Quebec resident Parents or sponsor deceased and one of parents was a Quebec resident All other situations are considered temporary categories. If you are considered temporary you only have to renew your residency status if you are absent for more than two sessions (not including Summer sessions).  If your application is rejected If you are not eligible for Quebec Resident status under one of the 14 situations, you may be eligible for one of the other situations. Or you may plan your studies so as to be eligible at a later date. Full-time versus part-time student status For Quebec Residency purposes, full-time and part-time status does not correspond to what is in the Concordia calendar. This is how the Quebec government defines it:  For Undergraduate students Part-Time is defined as registration in fewer than 12.0 credits per session Full-Time is defined as registration in 12.0 credits or more per session For Graduate students in a Graduate Independent, Diploma or Certificate program: Part-Time is defined as registration in fewer than 8.0 credits per session  Full-Time is defined as registration in 8.0 credits or more per session. Also, when counting the number of credits per term, courses with the grade DISC are included but courses that were withdrawn before the deadline to obtain a refund and that received the grade DNE are not included. Graduate students in a Masters or PhD program are classified as Full-Time or Part-Time at the time of initial registration in the program. This classification of Masters FT/PT status may be used for Quebec Residency purposes. If I have a Permanent Code, does this mean I am automatically a Québec Resident? No, there is no specific connection between a Permanent Code and Québec residency. A Permanent Code is a unique identifying code assigned by the Ministry of Education to all students who attend an educational institution in Québec regardless of where they come from and regardless of their residency status. Even if you have a Permanent Code you will still have to prove that you are eligible for Québec resident status.
